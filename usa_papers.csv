Using deep learning to predict internalizing problems from brain structure in youth.,40654936,Azadeh Kushki,Bloorview Research Institute,N/A,"Internalizing problems (e.g., anxiety and depression) are associated with a wide range of adverse outcomes. While some predictors of internalizing problems are known (e.g., their frequent co-occurrence with neurodevelopmental (ND) conditions), the biological markers of internalizing problems are not well understood. Here, we used deep learning, a powerful tool for identifying complex and multi-dimensional brain-behaviour relationships, to predict cross-sectional and worsening longitudinal trajectories of internalizing problems. Data were extracted from four large-scale datasets: the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study, the Healthy Brain Network, the Human Connectome Project Development study, and the Province of Ontario Neurodevelopmental network. We developed deep learning models that used measures of brain structure (thickness, surface area, and volume) to (a) predict clinically significant internalizing problems cross-sectionally (<i>N</i>=14,523); and (b) predict subsequent worsening trajectories (using the reliable change index) of internalizing problems (<i>N</i>=10,540) longitudinally. A stratified cross-validation scheme was used to tune, train, and test the models, which were evaluated using the area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC). The cross-sectional model performed well across the sample, reaching an AUC of 0.80[95% CI: 0.71,0.88]. For the longitudinal model, while performance was sub-optimal for predicting worsening trajectories in a sample of the general population (AUC=0.66[0.65,0.67]), good performance was achieved in a small, external test set of primarily ND conditions (AUC=0.80[0.78,0.81]), as well as across all ND conditions (AUC=0.73[0.70,0.76]). Deep learning with features of brain structure is a promising avenue for biomarkers of internalizing problems, particularly for individuals who have a higher likelihood of experiencing difficulties.",Anxiety,DeepLearning,Neuroimaging
Advancing scientific understanding of the drive to socially engage: from broad constructs to transdiagnostic 'building blocks'.,40858780,Mirko Uljarevic,Stanford University,Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences,"Reduced drive to socially engage is observed across neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions. However, previous research has relied on disorder-specific conceptualizations and measurement approaches that might obscure important differences in how social drive manifests and its underlying neurobiological mechanisms, both within and across different diagnostic categories. In this commentary, we argue that a model of reward processing that deconstructs social drive into 'orienting', 'wanting', 'pursuing', 'liking' and 'learning' processes can advance mechanistic and phenomenological understanding. Implementing this framework necessitates a multimethod measurement approach, combining rigorously validated behavioral measures and neurobiological sampling while leveraging specific developmental principles within a longitudinal research framework. Through these concerted efforts, the field will make significant strides towards developing a biologically grounded account of clinical phenomena characterized by different profiles of atypical drive to engage with others, which is a first and critical step toward the development of accurate prediction models and specific treatments.",Engagement,Unknown,Unknown
Genome Sequencing Uncovers Additional Findings in Phelan-McDermid Syndrome.,40519070,Audrey Thurm,National Institute of Mental Health,N/A,"Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS) is a genetic condition caused by deletions of chromosome 22q13.3 or pathogenic variants in the SHANK3 gene. Neurologic features typically include intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, hypotonia, and absent speech, though there is considerable variability even among individuals with the same molecular cause. This prospective study aimed to explore the utility of genome sequencing to identify additional molecular diagnoses that may contribute to variability in a cohort of patients with PMS. Twenty probands diagnosed with PMS (60% with a 22q13 deletion, 40% with a SHANK3 variant) underwent trio or duo genome sequencing and chromosomal microarray. This analysis identified a second molecular finding associated with a neurological condition in 3/20 participants. Molecular diagnoses related to neurological phenotypes included: (1) spinal muscular atrophy, lower extremity-predominant, 2A, autosomal dominant (SMALED2A), (2) spastic paraplegia 7, and (3) 16p11.2 deletion syndrome. Five additional new molecular diagnoses were associated with a clinically actionable secondary or incidental finding. This exploratory study provides early evidence for the potential utility of expanded sequencing among individuals with PMS, even for those without phenotypic features outside of the expected range.",Autism,Unknown,Unknown
Explainable AI reveals tissue pathology and psychosocial drivers of opioid prescription for non-specific chronic low back pain.,40841394,Sharmila Majumdar,University of California San Francisco,Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging,"Effective management of non-specific chronic lower back pain (ns-cLBP) requires nuanced prescription decisions within evolving guidelines for conservative treatment. This study developed comprehensive LBP patient profiles from electronic medical records (EMR), integrating clinical charts (demographics, social determinants, diagnoses, medications) and radiology reports (MRI-confirmed diagnoses) to predict pharmacological management strategies. One-vs-one and one-vs-rest classification frameworks systematically evaluated treatment decisions across three prescriptions: no medication, NSAIDs, and opioids. Real-world complexity and heterogeneity in ns-cLBP management was reflected in modest yet clinically meaningful performance metrics (balanced accuracy = 0.58, AUC = 0.62, F1-score = 0.42). Chart-documented diagnoses marginally outperformed MRI-reported pathology as predictors, though this difference was within the range of variability, which suggests the importance of diagnoses informed by patient-reported symptoms in shaping treatment pathways. SHAP feature importance analysis identified consistent predictors (year_at_first_imaging) and variable factors (spinal_stenosis, disc_pathology, race_ethnicity, negative_psych_state, osteoarthritis_osteoarthrosis) in prescriptions, with higher associations observed in those with anxiety or depression, partnered individuals and females. By leveraging explainable AI, this study quantifies the interplay between biological and psychosocial drivers of prescribing decisions, offering a transparent, data-driven monitoring tool for understanding in chronic pain care. These findings demonstrate the potential of multi-modal EMR data and interpretable models to guide more personalized, equitable ns-cLBP management and opioid prescriptions.",Anxiety,Unknown,MRI
Cardiovascular Disease Update: Heart Failure Update.,40829047,Dustin K Smith,Jacksonville Family Medicine Residency Program at Naval Hospital Jacksonville,N/A,"Heart failure (HF) is a clinical condition characterized by the heart's inability to pump blood effectively enough to meet the body's metabolic demands; typically this happens because of impaired ventricular filling or ejection. HF affects millions of people in the United States, with increasing prevalence, hospitalizations, and deaths. Classification of HF by left ventricular ejection fraction divides it into HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), mildly reduced ejection fraction, and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Early diagnosis and appropriate staging, using tools such as natriuretic peptides and echocardiography, are essential for identifying HF and implementing effective treatment. In patients with HFrEF, guideline-directed medical therapy, comprising renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, beta blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, has demonstrated reductions in morbidity, mortality, and hospitalizations. Management of comorbidities such as the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for obesity in patients with HFpEF has improved outcomes. Advanced therapies, cardiac rehabilitation, and supportive interventions, including vaccinations and mental health screening, contribute to improved patient quality of life. Focusing on pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies is essential to reduce HF progression, minimize hospitalizations, and improve overall survival.",Screening,Unknown,Echocardiography
Evaluating the Efficacy of ChatGPT-3.5 Versus Human-Delivered Text-Based Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy: A Comparative Pilot Study.,40820507,Eric Jarmon,Rutgers New Jersey Medical School,Department of Psychiatry,"The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of an artificial intelligence (AI) therapist (ChatGPT-3.5) and a human therapist in delivering text-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Cognitive Therapy Rating Scale (CTRS) scores and qualitative responses from participants were used to assess ChatGPT-3.5's capabilities within the limitations of this deployment. A cross-sectional survey was administered to 208 mental health professionals and trainees, 75 of whom completed the study. Participants assessed two text-based CBT transcripts (AI therapist and human therapist) using the CTRS and provided qualitative feedback. Both the AI therapist and the human therapist were presented with identical clinical scenarios to ensure consistency. The human therapist outperformed ChatGPT-3.5 across most CTRS domains (α=0.001). More than half (52%) of the respondents rated the human therapist's agenda setting highest, with a score of 6, compared with 28% who gave this rating to ChatGPT-3.5. In elicited feedback, 29% rated the human therapist as highly effective (score=6), whereas only 9% rated ChatGPT-3.5 similarly (p<0.001). The human therapist also scored higher on guided discovery (24% vs. 12%, p<0.001). ChatGPT-3.5 was rated similarly to the human therapist in understanding the patient's internal reality (36% vs. 19%, p=0.004) but was often seen as less personalized and more rigid. The findings suggest that although ChatGPT-3.5 may complement human-based therapy, this specific implementation of AI lacked the depth required for stand-alone use. These findings, however, cannot be generalized to all AI-based therapy because the study did not account for the diverse ways therapy can be delivered.",Therapy,ChatGPT-3.5,Text
Radiomics in pediatric brain tumors: from images to insights.,40817158,Abhishek Mahajan,The Clatterbridge Cancer Centre NHS Foundation Trust,Department of Imaging,"Radiomics has emerged as a promising non-invasive imaging approach in pediatric neuro-oncology, offering the ability to extract high-dimensional quantitative features from routine MRI to support diagnosis, risk stratification, molecular characterization, and outcome prediction. Pediatric brain tumors, which differ significantly from adult tumors in biology and imaging appearance, present unique diagnostic and prognostic challenges. By integrating radiomics with machine learning algorithms, studies have demonstrated strong performance in classifying tumor types such as medulloblastoma, ependymoma, and gliomas, and predicting molecular subgroups and mutations such as H3K27M and BRAF. Recent studies combining radiomics with machine learning algorithms - including support vector machines, random forests, and deep learning CNNs - have demonstrated promising performance, with AUCs ranging from 0.75 to 0.98 for tumor classification and 0.77 to 0.88 for molecular subgroup prediction, across cohorts from 50 to over 450 patients, with internal cross-validation and external validation in some cases. In resource-limited settings or regions with limited radiologist manpower, radiomics-based tools could help augment diagnostic accuracy and consistency, serving as decision support to prioritize patients for further evaluation or biopsy. Emerging applications such as radio-immunomics and radio-pathomics may further enhance understanding of tumor biology but remain investigational. Despite its potential, clinical translation faces notable barriers, including limited pediatric-specific datasets, variable imaging protocols, and the lack of standardized, reproducible workflows. Multi-institutional collaboration, harmonized pipelines, and prospective validation are essential next steps. Radiomics should be viewed as a supplementary tool that complements existing clinical and pathological frameworks, supporting more informed and equitable care in pediatric brain tumor management.",Unknown,Algorithms,MRI
The Psychiatric Genomics Consortium: discoveries and directions.,40582370,Patrick F Sullivan,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,Department of Psychiatry,"Research by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) has advanced the discovery of common and rare genetic variations that contribute to the susceptibility to many psychiatric disorders and neurodevelopmental conditions. This Review reflects on major findings from the past 5 years of research by the PGC in five priority areas: discovery of common variants using genome-wide association studies; rare variation and its interplay with polygenic risk; using genetics to go beyond diagnostic boundaries; ascribing functional attributes to genomic discoveries; and developing and implementing processes for data sharing, outreach to various communities, and training. The insights gained in these domains frame the agenda for the next phase of PGC research. In addition to accelerating integrative findings of common and rare variants within, and across, multiple psychiatric disorders and neurodevelopmental conditions, the next phase will use multiple populations to elucidate genetic causes, integrate results with rapidly accumulating multimodal functional genomics data to gain mechanistic understanding, convert genetic findings to clinically actionable phenotypes, such as treatment response, and address the emerging use of polygenic scores. Together, these next steps will highlight the biological underpinnings of psychiatric disorders and neurodevelopmental conditions, which continue to contribute to global morbidity and mortality.",Psychiatry,Unknown,Unknown
Tractography from T1-weighted MRI: Empirically exploring the clinical viability of streamline propagation without diffusion MRI.,40800467,Bennett A Landman,Vanderbilt University,Department of Biomedical Engineering,"Over the last few decades, diffusion MRI (dMRI) streamline tractography has emerged as the dominant method for<i>in vivo</i>estimation of white matter (WM) pathways in the brain. One key limitation to this technique is that modern tractography implementations require high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI). However, HARDI can be difficult to collect clinically, limiting the reach of tractography analyses to research cohorts and thus limiting many WM investigations to certain populations and pathologies. As such, a clinically viable tractography solution applicable to wider patient populations scanned as a part of routine care would be of key significance in broadening WM analyses to underfunded or rarer diseases and to the clinical setting. Such a solution would require the ability to perform arbitrary tractography analyses, use only clinical imaging for input, and be open source and widely accessible and implementable. Thus, here we evaluate our recently developed, containerized, and open-source, T1-weighted (T1w) MRI-based deep learning model for streamline propagation. We empirically assess its performance against traditional dMRI-based and established atlas-based approaches in a healthy young population, an aging one, and in those with epilepsy, depression, and brain cancer. In the healthy young population, we find slightly increased error compared to traditional tractography with the deep learning model that falls within the bounds attributable to dMRI variability and is considerably less than the atlas-based approach. Further, seeking to replicate previously published dMRI tractography effects in the remaining cohorts as an initial assessment of clinical viability, we find this model successfully does so in some key cases-particularly in applications that rely on long-range streamlines including those not captured by the atlas-based approach-but importantly not all. These results suggest a deep learning-based approach to tractography with T1w MRI demonstrates promise within the limitations of our definition of clinical viability and especially over atlas-based approaches but requires refinement and more robust consideration of out-of-distribution effects prior to widespread clinical use. We also find these results raise additional questions regarding the differences in image content between dMRI and T1w MRI and their relationship to tractography. Further investigation of these questions will improve the field's understanding of which features of the brain influence measured tractography effects.",Depression,Unknown,MRI
Exposotypes in psychotic disorders.,40781464,Matcheri S Keshavan,Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,"Psychiatry lags in adopting etiological approaches to diagnosis, prognosis, and outcome prediction compared to the rest of medicine. Etiological factors such as childhood trauma (CHT), substance use (SU), and socioeconomic status (SES) significantly affect psychotic disorder symptoms. This study applied an agnostic clustering approach to identify exposome clusters ""Exposotypes (ETs)"" and examine their relationship with clinical, cognitive, and functional outcomes. Using data from individuals with psychotic disorders (n = 1,350), and controls (n = 623), we assessed the relationship between the exposotypes and outcomes. Four exposotypes were identified: ET1 characterized by high CHT and SU; ET2, high CHT; ET3, high SU; ET4, low exposure. Compared to ET4, ET1 demonstrated higher positive and general symptoms, anxiety, depression, impulsivity, and mania; ET2 had higher anxiety, depression, and impulsivity; ET3 had better cognitive and functional outcomes with lower negative symptoms. Intracranial volume was largest in ET3, and smallest in ET2. No group differences in schizophrenia polygenic risk scores were found. The age of onset was 5 years earlier in ET1 than in ET4. These findings provide insight into the complex etiological interplay between trauma, and SU, as well as their unique effects on clinical symptoms, cognition, neurobiology, genetic risk, and functioning.",Psychosis,Clustering,Unknown
"Multi-photon, label-free photoacoustic and optical imaging of NADH in brain cells.",40775235,Peter T C So,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Department of Mechanical Engineering,"Label-free detection of biological events at single-cell resolution in the brain can non-invasively capture brain status for medical diagnosis and basic neuroscience research. NADH is an universal coenzyme that not only plays a central role in cellular metabolism but may also be used as a biomarker to capture metabolic processes in brain cells and structures. We have developed a new label-free, multiphoton photoacoustic microscope (LF-MP-PAM) with a near-infrared femtosecond laser to observe endogenous NAD(P)H in living cells. The imaging depth of NAD(P)H in tissues with all-optical methods is limited to ~100 μm in brain tissue by the strong absorption of the near-ultraviolet fluorescence. Here, acoustic detection of the thermal signature of multi-photon (three-photon) excitation of NAD(P)H, a low quantum yield fluorophore, allows detection at an unprecedented depth while the focused excitation ensures high spatial resolution. We validated the photoacoustic detection of NAD(P)H by monitoring an increase in intracellular NAD(P)H in HEK293T cells and HepG2 cells incubated in NADH solution. We also demonstrated the detection of endogenous NAD(P)H photoacoustic signals in brain slices to 700 μm depth and in cerebral organoids to 1100 μm depth. Finally, we developed and demonstrated simultaneous photoacoustic and optical imaging of NAD(P)H in brain cells with a real-time image acquisition and processing pipeline. This approach could open a new door to monitor brain metabolic changes during development and disease, and changes due to neuronal activity, at single-cell level deep in the brains of both humans and animals.",Metabolism,Unknown,Photoacoustic
Effective connectivity between the cerebellum and fronto-temporal regions correctly classify major depressive disorder: fMRI study using a multi-site dataset.,40609648,Bihong T Chen,City of Hope National Medical Center,Department of Diagnostic Radiology,"Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) diagnosis mainly relies on subjective self-reporting and clinical assessments. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and its analysis of Effective Connectivity (EC) offer a quantitative approach to understand the directional interactions between brain regions, presenting a potential objective method for MDD classification. Granger causality analysis was used to extract EC features from a large, multi-site rs-fMRI dataset of MDD patients. The ComBat algorithm was applied to adjust for site differences, while multivariate linear regression was employed to control for age and sex differences. Discriminative EC features for MDD were identified using two-sample t-tests and model-based feature selection, with the LightGBM algorithm being used for classification. The performance and generalizability of the model was evaluated using nested five-fold cross-validation and tested for generalizability on an independent dataset. Ninety-seven EC features belonging to the cerebellum and front-temporal regions were identified as highly discriminative for MDD. The classification model using these features achieved an accuracy of 94.35 %, with a sensitivity of 93.52 % and specificity of 95.25 % in cross-validation. Generalization of the model to an independent dataset resulted in an accuracy of 94.74 %, sensitivity of 90.59 %, and specificity of 96.75 %. The study demonstrates that EC features from rs-fMRI can effectively discriminate MDD from healthy controls, suggesting that EC analysis could be a valuable tool in assisting the clinical diagnosis of MDD. This method shows promise in enhancing the objectivity of MDD diagnosis through the use of neuroimaging biomarkers.",Depression,LightGBM,fMRI
Treatment resistant recurrent unipolar and bipolar depression: associative learning abnormalities.,40755210,J Douglas Steele,University of Dundee,Division of Neuroscience,"Severe and enduring psychiatric illness affects about three percent of the UK population and is associated with significant disability and a substantial reduction in average life expectancy. Two types are treatment resistant recurrent unipolar depression and treatment resistant bipolar depression, the latter being the depressed phase of bipolar disorder. Different phenotypes and different responses to antidepressant medications suggest different neural abnormalities. As bipolar depression can be clinically indistinguishable from unipolar depression yet require different treatments, development of objective ways to discriminate these two illnesses are important. Here we used reinforcement learning drift diffusion models of decision making, and event-related fMRI acquired during a reward gain and loss avoidance task, to investigate patients with treatment resistant recurrent unipolar depression and bipolar depression, in long term General Adult Psychiatry follow up. We tested the null hypothesis that both unipolar and bipolar depressive illnesses show similarly blunted reward learning signals, and increased loss avoidance learning signals, with similar psychomotor slowing. Consistent with our null hypothesis, we found abnormally slowed decision making for both depression types, with individual patient reinforcement learning drift diffusion model parameter estimates correlating with depression severity. For unipolar depression, we found blunted outcome and value signals for positive feedback, and increased signals for negative feedback. However, in contrast to our null hypothesis, bipolar depression was associated with preserved striatal reward prediction error signalling, and an absence of hippocampal and lateral orbitofrontal enhanced encoding of loss events, which was present for unipolar depression. Overall then, both treatment resistant recurrent unipolar depression and treatment resistant bipolar depression showed a similar pattern of neural abnormality compared to controls for the lateral orbitofrontal cortex reward value signal and the amygdala loss value signal. However, the illnesses also differed significantly, particularly with regard to hippocampal, striatal, and lateral orbitofrontal function, potentially allowing objective discrimination. Using a support vector machine with the results of our neuroimaging analyses, it was also possible to differentiate the two depression types with an accuracy of 74.3%. Further studies of currently ill patients with severe and enduring illness are indicated.",Depression,Support,fMRI
Multi-Label Classification with Generative AI Models in Healthcare: A Case Study of Suicidality and Risk Factors.,40740509,Hongfang Liu,The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston,McWilliams School of Biomedical Informatics,"Suicide remains a pressing global health crisis, with over 720,000 deaths annually and millions more affected by suicide ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SA). Early identification of suicidality-related factors (SrFs), including SI, SA, exposure to suicide (ES), and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), is critical for timely intervention. While prior studies have applied AI to detect SrFs in clinical notes, most treat suicidality as a binary classification task, overlooking the complexity of co-occurring risk factors. This study explores the use of generative large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.5, for multi-label classification (MLC) of SrFs from psychiatric electronic health records (EHRs). We present a novel end-to-end generative MLC pipeline and introduce advanced evaluation methods, including label-set-level metrics and a multi-label confusion matrix for error analysis. Fine-tuned GPT-3.5 achieved top performance with 0.94 partial-match accuracy and 0.91 F1 score, while GPT-4.5 with guided prompting showed superior performance across label sets, including rare or minority label sets, indicating a more balanced and robust performance. Our findings reveal systematic error patterns, such as the conflation of SI and SA, and highlight the models' tendency toward cautious over-labeling. This work not only demonstrates the feasibility of using generative AI for complex clinical classification tasks but also provides a blueprint for structuring unstructured EHR data to support large-scale clinical research and evidence-based medicine.",Suicide,GPT-4.5,Unknown
Polygenic prediction of body mass index and obesity through the life course and across ancestries.,40691366,Ruth J F Loos,The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine,Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,"Polygenic scores (PGSs) for body mass index (BMI) may guide early prevention and targeted treatment of obesity. Using genetic data from up to 5.1 million people (4.6% African ancestry, 14.4% American ancestry, 8.4% East Asian ancestry, 71.1% European ancestry and 1.5% South Asian ancestry) from the GIANT consortium and 23andMe, Inc., we developed ancestry-specific and multi-ancestry PGSs. The multi-ancestry score explained 17.6% of BMI variation among UK Biobank participants of European ancestry. For other populations, this ranged from 16% in East Asian-Americans to 2.2% in rural Ugandans. In the ALSPAC study, children with higher PGSs showed accelerated BMI gain from age 2.5 years to adolescence, with earlier adiposity rebound. Adding the PGS to predictors available at birth nearly doubled explained variance for BMI from age 5 onward (for example, from 11% to 21% at age 8). Up to age 5, adding the PGS to early-life BMI improved prediction of BMI at age 18 (for example, from 22% to 35% at age 5). Higher PGSs were associated with greater adult weight gain. In intensive lifestyle intervention trials, individuals with higher PGSs lost modestly more weight in the first year (0.55 kg per s.d.) but were more likely to regain it. Overall, these data show that PGSs have the potential to improve obesity prediction, particularly when implemented early in life.",Obesity,Unknown,Unknown

Functional Inputs to the Subgenual Cingulate Cortex Distinguish Neurotypical Individuals with Severe and Mild Depressive Problems: Granger Causality and Clustering Analyses.,40667126,Chiang-Shan R Li,Yale University School of Medicine,Department of Psychiatry,"Extant research has implicated functional connectivity of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) in major depressive disorders or depressive traits in neurotypical populations. However, prior studies have not distinguished the inputs and outputs of the sgACC, and the ""diagnostic"" accuracy of these connectivity metrics remains elusive. Here, we analyzed data of 890 subjects (459 women, age 22 to 35) from the Human Connectome Project using Granger causality analyses (GCA) with the sgACC as the seed and 268 regions of interest from the Shen's atlas as targets. Individual connectivities were assessed with an <i>F</i> test and group results were evaluated with a binomial test, both at a corrected threshold. We identified brain regions with significant input to and output from the sgACC. Clustering analyses of Granger causality input, but not Granger causality output or resting state connectivity features revealed distinct subject clusters, effectively distinguishing individuals with severe and mild depressive symptoms and those with comorbidities. Specifically, weaker projections from the fronto-parietal and orbitofrontal cortices, anterior insula, temporal cortices, and cerebellum to the sgACC characterized five clusters with low to high scores of depression as well as comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems. Machine learning using a logistic classifier with the significant ""GCA-in"" features and 5-fold cross-validation achieved 87% accuracy in distinguishing subject clusters, including those with high vs. low depression. These new findings specify the functional inputs and outputs of the sgACC and highlight an outsized role of sgACC inputs in distinguishing individuals with depressive and comorbid problems.",Depression,Classifier,Unknown
Evaluating the Usability of an HIV Prevention Artificial Intelligence Chatbot in Malaysia: National Observational Study.,40663792,Frederick L Altice,Yale University,Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS (CIRA),"Malaysia, an upper middle-income country in the Asia-Pacific region, has an HIV epidemic that has transitioned from needle sharing to sexual transmission, mainly in men who have sex with men (MSM). MSM are the most vulnerable population for HIV in Malaysia. In 2022, our team developed a web-based artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot and tested its feasibility and acceptability among MSM in Malaysia to promote HIV testing. To enhance the usability of the AI chatbot, we made it accessible to the public through the website called MYHIV365 and tested it in an observational study. This study aimed to test the usability of an AI chatbot in promoting HIV testing among MSM living in Malaysia. This observational study was conducted from August 2023 to March 2024 among 334 MSM. Participants were recruited through community outreach and social-networking apps using flyers. The interactions between participants and the AI chatbot were documented and retrieved from the chatbot developer's platform. Data were analyzed following a predefined metrics using R software (Posit Software, PBC). The AI chatbot interacted with 334 participants, assisting them in receiving free HIV self-testing kits, offering information on HIV, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and mental health, and providing details of 220 MSM-friendly clinics, including their addresses, phone numbers, and operating hours. After the study, 393 human-chatbot interactions were documented on the chatbot developer's platform. Most participants (304/334, 91.0%) interacted with the AI chatbot once, 30 (9.0%) engaged 2 or more times at different intervals. Participants' interaction time with the chatbot varied, ranging from 1 to 31 minutes. The AI chatbot properly addressed most participants' questions (362/393, 92.1%) about HIV and PrEP. However, in 31 interactions, participants posed additional questions to the chatbot that were not programmed into the chatbot algorithms, resulting in unanswered interactions. The web-based AI chatbot demonstrated high usability in delivering HIV self-testing kits and providing clinical information on HIV testing, PrEP, and mental health services. To enhance its usability in community and clinical settings, the chatbot must offer personalized health information and precise interaction, powered by sophisticated machine learning algorithms. In addition, establishing an effective connection between the AI chatbot and health care systems to eliminate stigma and discrimination toward MSM is crucial for the future implementation of AI chatbots.",PrEP,Unknown,Unknown
Advancing Early Detection of Major Depressive Disorder Using Multisite Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data: Comparative Analysis of AI Models.,40663721,Kashif Ansari,East Houston Medical Center,East Houston Medical Center,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent mental health condition with significant public health implications. Early detection is crucial for timely intervention, but current diagnostic methods often rely on subjective clinical assessments, leading to delayed or inaccurate diagnoses. Advances in neuroimaging and machine learning (ML) offer the potential for objective and accurate early detection. This study aimed to develop and validate ML models using multisite functional magnetic resonance imaging data for the early detection of MDD, compare their performance, and evaluate their clinical applicability. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 1200 participants (600 with early-stage MDD and 600 healthy controls) across 3 public datasets. In total, 4 ML models-support vector machine, random forest, gradient boosting machine, and deep neural network-were trained and evaluated using a 5-fold cross-validation framework. Models were assessed for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Shapley additive explanations values and activation maximization techniques were applied to interpret model predictions. The deep neural network model demonstrated superior performance with an accuracy of 89% (95% CI 86%-92%) and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 (95% CI 0.93-0.97), outperforming traditional diagnostic methods by 15% (P<.001). Key predictive features included altered functional connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and limbic regions. The model achieved 78% sensitivity (95% CI 71%-85%) in identifying individuals who developed MDD within a 2-year follow-up period, demonstrating good generalizability across datasets. Our findings highlight the potential of artificial intelligence-driven approaches for the early detection of MDD, with implications for improving early intervention strategies. While promising, these tools should complement rather than replace clinical expertise, with careful consideration of ethical implications such as patient privacy and model biases.",Depression,Neural,MRI

This study employed social media listening (SML) to analyze 4,787 relevant posts from X, Reddit, Facebook, blogs, and forums discussing oral medication administration to dogs. Large language models (LLMs) were used for data cleaning, relevancy filtering and analysis. Topic modeling, sentiment and thematic analyses were conducted to identify key themes and challenges. Analysis revealed significant anxiety and fear associated with medication administration, with 12% of posts mentioning anxiety and additional fear-related terms appearing in 1-3% of posts. Only 7.6% of posts discussed soft/chewable medications, which showed positive sentiment and preference. Geographic analysis showed posts predominantly from English-speaking countries (US 70.3%, UK 17.8%). Five major themes emerged from X, Reddit, blogs and forums: general medication/veterinary experiences, pill types and practices, pill delivery methods, specific medications/preventatives, product reviews/natural remedies. Financial concerns were prominent, with pet owners describing medication costs as barriers to optimal care. Successful pilling strategies included hiding pills in peanut butter, cheese or meat products; crushing pills and mixing with food, and using distraction techniques. The study identified key barriers to compliance including financial constraints, fear and anxiety, mistrust of veterinary advice and practical administration challenges. Pet owners showed higher adherence when treatments visibly improved quality of life or addressed chronic conditions. Chewable formulations were preferred but raised concerns about accidental overdosing. The methodology demonstrated that SML combined with AI analysis effectively captures real-world pet owner experiences. This novel approach revealed that dog owners face significant psychological and practical barriers when administering oral medications. Chewable formulations may improve compliance, though proper storage and education are essential. The study provides veterinarians with evidence-based successful pilling strategies reported by pet owners and highlights the need for better communication about treatment benefits, financial planning options and alternative delivery methods to improve medication adherence.",Anxiety,LLMs,Unknown
Network homeostasis: functional brain network alterations and relapse in remitted late-life depression.,40442463,Carmen Andreescu,University of Pittsburgh,Department of Psychiatry,"Late-life depression (LLD) is highly recurrent and associated with disability and increased mortality. In this study, we aim to identify neurobiological factors that are prospectively associated with relapse risk in late-life depression. We recruited 145 older adults (age ≥ 60): 102 recently remitted LLD participants and 43 healthy comparisons. Participants underwent baseline MRI and evaluation of depression symptoms/status for up to 2 years. We evaluated intrinsic network connectivity for 111 participants (39 healthy comparisons, 47 stable remitted, 25 relapsed). Compared to healthy comparisons, LLD participants had lower connectivity within the somatomotor network and greater connectivity between the executive control and default mode networks (DMN). Lower connectivity of DMN to somatomotor and salience networks was associated with relapse. Overall, connectivity of relapse participants was more similar to healthy comparisons than connectivity of stable remitted participants was. We found robust differences in network functional connectivity between stable remitted and relapsed participants. We also found evidence of neural ""scarring,"" or persistent functional network differences at baseline in all participants with a history of depression. Alterations in DMN connectivity were observed most prominently. Notably, the network structure of relapsed participants was more similar to healthy comparisons than stable remitted participants. These findings indicate that remission is associated with persistent functional network alterations while vulnerability to relapse is associated with a failure to establish a new stable homeostatic functional network structure.",Depression,Unknown,MRI
Individualized functional brain mapping machine learning prediction of symptom-change resulting from selective kappa-opioid antagonism in an anhedonic sample from a Fast-Fail trial.,40657347,Diego A Pizzagalli,McLean Hospital,Center for Depression,"Anhedonia remains a difficult-to-treat symptom and has been associated with poor clinical course transdiagnostically. Here, we applied machine learning models to individualized neural patches derived from fMRI data during the Monetary Incentive Delay Task in anhedonic participants (N = 67) recruited for a clinical trial examining K-opioid receptor (KOR) antagonism in the treatment of anhedonia. Nine ensemble models were estimated using cortical, subcortical, and combined cortical subcortical features from individualized functional topographies to predict changes in symptoms of overall psychopathology (anhedonia, depression, anxiety). Analyses were performed on the KOR (N = 33) and placebo (N = 34) group. Initial models showed that only subcortical data predicting depression and anxiety symptom change had a significant Spearman correlation between veridical and predicted data (<i>rho</i> = 0.480 and <i>rho</i> = 0.415 respectively). Next, leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) showed that the best-performing models comprised only the subcortical individualized systems data, which correlated with clinical change for depression and anxiety scores for the KOR group with significantly higher accuracy (<i>rho</i> = 0.634 and <i>rho</i> = 0.562, respectively) compared to the placebo group (<i>rho</i> = 0.294 and <i>rho</i> = 0.034, respectively). Further, 25 subcortical neural features were identified based on correlation and ensemble determined importance in driving prediction. Final models for both depression and anxiety showed an overall higher representation of the dorsal attention network. Cortical and combined cortical-subcortical feature data showed no significant improvement in prediction of clinical change between the two groups. Using an ensemble of machine learning approaches, we identified individual differences in subcortical individualized systems data that predicted clinical change that was specific to KOR antagonism.",Anhedonia,Ensemble,fMRI
Predicting OCD severity from religiosity and personality: A machine learning and neural network approach.,40655911,Gregory N Muller,University of Texas at Austin,Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) affects a significant portion of the United States population. The present study investigated the complex relationships among OCD severity, personality traits, religiosity, and spirituality with a dataset of 229 participants. We applied advanced machine and deep learning techniques to identify key predictors of OCD severity, uncovering nuanced relationships and unexpected findings. Notably, item-level features were more influential than aggregate scores, challenging traditional analytical approaches. Moreover, a neural network model, despite not surpassing a linear regression in predictive accuracy, provided a more comprehensive understanding of OCD's heterogeneity and of the nonlinear relationships between our variables. The inclusion of demographic factors provided further explanatory power for predicting OCD severity, emphasizing the multifaceted nature of the disorder. Our results show that machine learning models can nearly match traditional linear models in predictive power while retaining nonlinear relationships essential to understanding OCD. Our study advocates for the adoption of sophisticated predictive models in examining complex psychological phenomena, encouraging a reevaluation of conventional analytical approaches when prediction is central to research questions.",OCD,Neural,Unknown
"Lifestyle, Early-life, and Genetic Health Risk Factors Underlying the Brain Age Gap: A Mega-Analysis Across 3,934 Individuals from the ENIGMA MDD Consortium.",40655020,Lianne Schmaal,The University of Melbourne,N/A,"Large-scale studies show that adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) generally have a higher imaging-predicted age relative to their chronological age (i.e., positive brain age gap) compared to controls, though considerable within-group variation exists. This study examines lifestyle, early-life, and genetic health risk factors contributing to the brain age gap. Identifying risk and resilience factors could help protect brain and mental health. Using an established model trained on FreeSurfer-derived brain regions (www.photon-ai.com/enigma_brainage), we generated brain age predictions for 1,846 controls and 2,088 individuals with MDD (aged 18-75) from 12 international cohorts. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) were calculated for major depression, C-reactive protein, and body mass index (BMI) using large-scale GWAS results. Linear mixed models were applied to assess lifestyle (BMI, smoking, education), early-life childhood trauma, and genetic (PRS) health risk associations with the brain age gap. Additionally, we evaluated the link between the brain age gap and peripheral biological age indicators (epigenetic clocks). Higher brain age gaps were significantly associated with BMI (β=0.01, P<sub>FDR</sub>=0.02) and smoking (β=0.11, P<sub>FDR</sub>=0.02), while lower brain age gaps were linked to higher education (β=-0.02, P<sub>FDR</sub>=0.02). Higher childhood trauma scores predicted a higher brain age gap (β=0.04, P=0.01). Higher brain age gaps were positively associated with all PRS (βs=0.04-0.16, Ps<sub>FDR</sub>=0.02-0.03). There were no significant interactions between diagnosis and assessed factors on the brain age gap. In a multivariable model, only modifiable health factors-BMI, smoking, and education-remained uniquely associated with brain age gaps. Genetic liability for depression and related traits is linked to poorer brain health, but health behaviors potentially offer a key opportunity for intervention. This study underscores the importance of targeting modifiable lifestyle factors to mitigate poor brain health in depressed individuals, an approach perhaps under-recognized in clinical practice.",Depression,FreeSurfer,MRI
Gut microbiota composition is related to anxiety and aggression scores in companion dogs.,40624095,Carolyn J Walsh,Memorial University of Newfoundland,Department of Psychology,"There is mounting evidence for a link between behaviour and the gut microbiome in animal and human health. However, the role of the gut microbiome in the development and severity of behavioural issues in companion dogs is not yet fully understood. Here, we investigated the relationship between gut microbiota composition and aggression or anxiety in pet dogs. Dogs were assigned to higher or lower anxiety and aggression groups based on their owner's responses to the Canine Behavioral Assessment & Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ). Then, the gut microbiota composition of each animal, sequenced from microbial DNA extracted from fecal samples, was assessed for association with the dog's assigned behavioural group using multiple approaches. While minimal differences in relative abundance were seen between behavioural groups, machine-learning and compositional balance models could predict behavioural group based on gut microbiota composition. The genus Blautia was identified consistently across analyses, suggesting a link between this genus and anxiety in pet dogs. This study provides insight into specific bacteria that are linked to increased anxiety and aggression in pet dogs. Further research is required to identify bacteria to the species level, and to better understand the specific role of Blautia in the canine gut-brain axis.",Anxiety,Unknown,Unknown
Effective connectivity between the cerebellum and fronto-temporal regions correctly classify major depressive disorder: fMRI study using a multi-site dataset.,40609648,Bihong T Chen,City of Hope National Medical Center,Department of Diagnostic Radiology,"Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) diagnosis mainly relies on subjective self-reporting and clinical assessments. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and its analysis of Effective Connectivity (EC) offer a quantitative approach to understand the directional interactions between brain regions, presenting a potential objective method for MDD classification. Granger causality analysis was used to extract EC features from a large, multi-site rs-fMRI dataset of MDD patients. The ComBat algorithm was applied to adjust for site differences, while multivariate linear regression was employed to control for age and sex differences. Discriminative EC features for MDD were identified using two-sample t-tests and model-based feature selection, with the LightGBM algorithm being used for classification. The performance and generalizability of the model was evaluated using nested five-fold cross-validation and tested for generalizability on an independent dataset. Ninety-seven EC features belonging to the cerebellum and front-temporal regions were identified as highly discriminative for MDD. The classification model using these features achieved an accuracy of 94.35 %, with a sensitivity of 93.52 % and specificity of 95.25 % in cross-validation. Generalization of the model to an independent dataset resulted in an accuracy of 94.74 %, sensitivity of 90.59 %, and specificity of 96.75 %. The study demonstrates that EC features from rs-fMRI can effectively discriminate MDD from healthy controls, suggesting that EC analysis could be a valuable tool in assisting the clinical diagnosis of MDD. This method shows promise in enhancing the objectivity of MDD diagnosis through the use of neuroimaging biomarkers.",Depression,LightGBM,fMRI
Using Machine Learning to Predict Treatment Outcome in a Concatenated Dataset of Youth Anxiety Treatments.,40608185,Philip C Kendall,Temple University,Department of Psychology,"Machine Learning (ML) is a promising approach for predicting outcomes of youth anxiety treatments. To this end, data from nine randomized controlled trials of youth anxiety treatments were concatenated into a dataset (N = 1362; M<sub>age</sub> = 10.59, SD<sub>age</sub> = 2.47; 48.9% female; 71.9% White, 5.9% Black, Other, 5.9%; 10.8% Hispanic) and ML algorithms were used to predict outcomes. Models were then applied on an external validation sample in a research clinic (N = 50; M<sub>age</sub> = 12.04, SD<sub>age</sub> = 3.22; 56% female; 76% Caucasian, 10% Black, 6% Asian, 2% Other; 6% Hispanic). To examine predictive features by treatment type, Lasso Regression models were built separately for youth who completed individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), family CBT (FCBT), sertraline alone (SRT), and combination of SRT and CBT (COMB). Automatic relevance determination (ARD) emerged as the best performing model in the concatenated (RMSE = 1.84, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.28) and external validation datasets (RMSE = 1.87, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.11). Predictive features of poorer outcomes were primarily indicators of symptom severity and trial effects, although predictors varied within treatments (e.g., caregiver psychopathology was predictive for FCBT; depressive symptoms were predictive for COMB). Implications for use of ML to predict outcomes are discussed.",Anxiety,Lasso,Unknown
Distinct subnetworks of the mouse anterior thalamic nuclei.,40593635,Hong-Wei Dong,University of California Los Angeles,Department of Neurobiology,"Currently, classification of neuron types in the mouse thalamus remains largely incomplete. The anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN), a Papez circuit component, encompass the anterodorsal (AD), anteroventral (AV), and anteromedial (AM) thalamic nuclei. Structurally, the ATN facilitate communication among the neocortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and hypothalamus. Functionally, they play pivotal roles in learning, memory, spatial navigation, and goal-directed behaviors. Therefore, the ATN provide a promising avenue to investigate the relationship between structural and functional complexity with neuron type diversity. In male mice, comprehensive, systematically collected, pathway tracing data revealed several connectionally unique ATN cell populations, suggesting multiple parallel subnetworks run through each nucleus. Further, we applied genetic sparse labeling, brain clearing, 3D microscopic imaging, and computational informatics to morphologically characterize and catalog ATN neuron types. This study provides insights into how the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala interact through neuron type-specific ATN subnetworks to coordinate cognitive and emotional aspects of goal-directed behavior.",Behavior,Unknown,Imaging
A retrospective multi-institutional assessment of breast radiology and pathology report readability and a novel patient tool (MedEd) utilizing American literacy standards.,40583070,Kristin Rojas,University of Miami Miller School of Medicine,Department of Surgery,"Health literacy is a critical factor in patient engagement and outcomes during cancer survivorship. With the 21st Century Cures Act, patients now receive immediate access to radiology and pathology reports, yet these documents often exceed the 6th-grade reading level recommended by the American Medical Association. While prior studies have examined general breast cancer materials, the readability of individualized clinical reports remains unexplored. In this multi-institutional retrospective study, 120 de-identified breast radiology and pathology reports from the University of Colorado and the University of Miami were analyzed across six report types. Readability was assessed using six validated indices. Additionally, 98 MedEd definitions and 96 MedEd-directed online patient education materials (OPEMs) were evaluated. MedEd is a Chrome plug-in designed to highlight key breast health terms and provide physician-curated definitions with links to vetted educational content. Across institutions, most clinical reports exceeded a high school reading level, with surgical pathology reports being the least accessible. MedEd definitions and OPEMs demonstrated better readability but still surpassed the recommended 6th-grade level. Breast cancer-related reports and educational materials remain difficult for many survivors to comprehend. Improved design of patient-facing tools-potentially through AI integration and patient co-development-may enhance accessibility, empowerment, and shared decision-making. This study underscores a critical gap between the readability of breast radiology and pathology reports and the literacy levels of many cancer survivors. As patients gain immediate access to these documents through electronic portals, the complexity of medical language can lead to confusion, anxiety, and disengagement from care. Survivors may be particularly vulnerable during post-treatment surveillance when understanding follow-up imaging and pathology is vital for shared decision-making. Tools like MedEd-while promising-must continue to evolve to meet national literacy standards. Simplifying medical reports and integrating patient-centered, Al-supported education tools can enhance survivors' comprehension, foster autonomy, and ultimately improve their confidence and outcomes throughout survivorship.",Literacy,Unknown,Radiology
The Psychiatric Genomics Consortium: discoveries and directions.,40582370,Patrick F Sullivan,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,Department of Psychiatry,"Research by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) has advanced the discovery of common and rare genetic variations that contribute to the susceptibility to many psychiatric disorders and neurodevelopmental conditions. This Review reflects on major findings from the past 5 years of research by the PGC in five priority areas: discovery of common variants using genome-wide association studies; rare variation and its interplay with polygenic risk; using genetics to go beyond diagnostic boundaries; ascribing functional attributes to genomic discoveries; and developing and implementing processes for data sharing, outreach to various communities, and training. The insights gained in these domains frame the agenda for the next phase of PGC research. In addition to accelerating integrative findings of common and rare variants within, and across, multiple psychiatric disorders and neurodevelopmental conditions, the next phase will use multiple populations to elucidate genetic causes, integrate results with rapidly accumulating multimodal functional genomics data to gain mechanistic understanding, convert genetic findings to clinically actionable phenotypes, such as treatment response, and address the emerging use of polygenic scores. Together, these next steps will highlight the biological underpinnings of psychiatric disorders and neurodevelopmental conditions, which continue to contribute to global morbidity and mortality.",Psychiatry,Unknown,Unknown
A comprehensive hybrid model: Combining bioinspired optimization and deep learning for Alzheimer's disease identification.,40580613,Saurav Mallik,Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health,Department of Environmental Health,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a gradual decline in cognitive ability and memory function. It is a progressive disease characterized by worsening dementia symptoms over time, starting with mild memory loss and advancing to severe impairments in communication and responsiveness. The key motive of this work is to explore the new hybrid technique with parameter tuning for segmenting the brain sub regions, by satisfying the clinical targets in finding major biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aims to explore a new bioinspired hybrid technique for segmenting various brain regions to assist in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. To refine the segmentation accuracy, a combination of Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO) and Harris Hawk Optimization (HHO) approaches is proposed. Initially, the population is divided into two smaller groups, designated HHO and GWO, where both methods update subpopulation positions concurrently. The segmented region (SR) is validated with ground truth (GT) using different statistical measures and shows the highlighted accuracy of 92 %. According to the experimental results, the proposed hybrid technique provides an improved solution than HHO. After segmentation, deep learning (DL) technique is applied to classify the normal controls (NC) and AD. A 90 % classification accuracy is achieved when HHO and GWO are combined. Finally, the results are validated with clinical score, namely Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), which gives the support to observe the disease progression. This process demonstrates the hybrid method and it proves with remarkable results, in segmentation, classification and clinical validation. In this work, clinicians have assisted in disease progression monitoring, thereby improving patient care. Significance: This work provides assistance to diagnose AD and doctors to make a decision for further treatment.",Alzheimer's,Deeplearning,Unknown

Providing context: Extracting non-linear and dynamic temporal motifs from brain activity.,40504803,Vince Calhoun,Georgia Institute of Technology,School of Electrical and Computer Engineering,"Approaches studying the dynamics of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) activity often focus on time-resolved functional connectivity (tr-FC). While many tr-FC approaches have been proposed, most are linear approaches, e.g. computing the linear correlation at a timestep or within a window. In this work, we propose to use a generative non-linear deep learning model, a disentangled variational autoencoder (DSVAE), that factorizes out window-specific (context) information from timestep-specific (local) information. This has the advantage of allowing our model to capture differences at multiple temporal scales. We find that by separating out temporal scales our model's window-specific embeddings, or as we refer to them, context embeddings, more accurately separate windows from schizophrenia patients and control subjects than baseline models and the standard tr-FC approach in a low-dimensional space. Moreover, we find that for individuals with schizophrenia, our model's context embedding space is significantly correlated with both age and symptom severity. Interestingly, patients appear to spend more time in three clusters, one closer to controls which shows increased visual-sensorimotor, cerebellar-subcortical, and reduced cerebellar-visual functional network connectivity (FNC), an intermediate station showing increased subcortical-sensorimotor FNC, and one that shows decreased visual-sensorimotor, decreased subcortical-sensorimotor, and increased visual-subcortical domains. We verify that our model captures features that are complementary to - but not the same as - standard tr-FC features. Our model can thus help broaden the neuroimaging toolset in analyzing fMRI dynamics and shows potential as an approach for finding psychiatric links that are more sensitive to individual and group characteristics.",Schizophrenia,DSVAE,fMRI
Gene dosage effects of 22q11.2 copy number variants on in-vivo measures of white matter axonal density and dispersion.,40501680,Carrie E Bearden,Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior,N/A,"22q11.2 deletion (22qDel) and duplication (22qDup) carriers have an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders and exhibit altered brain structure, including white matter microstructure. However, the underlying cellular architecture and age-related changes contributing to these white matter alterations remain poorly understood. Neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) was used on mixed cross-sectional and longitudinal data to examine group differences and age-related trajectories in measures of axonal density (i.e., intracellular volume fraction; ICVF), axonal orientation (orientation dispersion index; ODI) and free water diffusion (isotropic volume fraction; ISO) in 50 22qDel (n scans = 69, mean age = 21.7, age range = 7.4-51.1, 65.2% female) and 24 22qDup (n scans = 34, mean age = 23.3, age range = 8.3-49.4, 55.0% female) carriers, and 890 controls (n scans = 901, mean age = 21.9, age range = 7.8-51.1, 54.5%). The results showed widespread gene dosage effects, with higher ICVF in 22qDel and lower ICVF in 22qDup compared to controls, and region-specific effects of the 22qDel and 22qDup on ODI and ISO measures. However, 22qDel and 22qDup carriers did not exhibit an altered age-related trajectory relative to controls. Observed differences in ICVF suggest higher white matter axonal density in 22qDel and lower axonal density in 22qDup compared to controls. Conversely, differences in ODI are highly localized, indicating region-specific effects on axonal dispersion in white matter. We do not find evidence for altered developmental trajectories of axonal density or dispersion among 22q11.2 CNV carriers, suggesting stable disruptions to neurodevelopmental events before childhood.",Neurodevelopment,Unknown,NODDI
Early life high fructose impairs microglial phagocytosis and neurodevelopment.,40500435,Justin S A Perry,Sloan Kettering Institute,Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center,"Despite the success of fructose as a low-cost food additive, epidemiological evidence suggests that high fructose consumption during pregnancy or adolescence is associated with disrupted neurodevelopment<sup>1-3</sup>. An essential step in appropriate mammalian neurodevelopment is the phagocytic elimination of newly formed neurons by microglia, the resident professional phagocyte of the central nervous system<sup>4</sup>. Whether high fructose consumption in early life affects microglial phagocytosis and whether this directly affects neurodevelopment remains unknown. Here we show that offspring born to female mice fed a high-fructose diet and neonates exposed to high fructose exhibit decreased phagocytic activity in vivo. Notably, deletion of the high-affinity fructose transporter GLUT5 (also known as SLC2A5) in neonatal microglia completely reversed microglia phagocytic dysfunction, suggesting that high fructose directly affects neonatal development by suppressing microglial phagocytosis. Mechanistically, we found that high-fructose treatment of mouse and human microglia suppresses phagocytosis capacity, which is rescued in GLUT5-deficient microglia. Additionally, we found that high fructose drives significant GLUT5-dependent fructose uptake and catabolism to fructose 6-phosphate, rewiring microglial metabolism towards a hypo-phagocytic state in part by enforcing mitochondrial localization of the enzyme hexokinase 2. Mice exposed to high fructose as neonates develop anxiety-like behaviour as adolescents-an effect that is rescued in GLUT5-deficient mice. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the epidemiological observation that high-fructose exposure during early life is associated with increased prevalence of adolescent anxiety disorders.",Anxiety,Unknown,Unknown

Automated Diffusion Analysis for Non-Invasive Prediction of IDH Genotype in WHO Grade 2-3 Gliomas.,40494626,Frederik Barkhof,University College London,Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering,"Glioma molecular characterization is essential for risk stratification and treatment planning. Noninvasive imaging biomarkers such as apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values have shown potential for predicting glioma genotypes. However, manual segmentation of gliomas is time-consuming and operator-dependent. To address this limitation, we aimed to establish a single-sequence-derived automatic ADC extraction pipeline using T2-weighted imaging to support glioma isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genotyping. Glioma volumes from a hospital data set (University College London Hospitals; n=247) were manually segmented on T2-weighted MRI scans using ITK-Snap Toolbox and co-registered to ADC maps sequences using the FMRIB Linear Image Registration Tool in FSL, followed by ADC histogram extraction (Python). Separately, a nnUNet deep learning algorithm was trained to segment glioma volumes using T2w only from BraTS 2021 data (n=500, 80% training, 5% validation and 15% test split). nnUnet was then applied to the University College London Hospitals (UCLH) data for segmentation and ADC read-outs. Univariable logistic regression was used to test the performance manual and nnUNet derived ADC metrics for IDH status prediction. Statistical equivalence was tested (paired two-sided t-test). nnUnet segmentation achieved a median Dice of 0.85 on BraTS data, and 0.83 on UCLH data. For the best performing metric (rADCmean) the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for differentiating IDH-mutant from IDHwildtype gliomas was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.78-0.88), compared to the manual segmentation AUC 0.84 (95% CI: 0.77-0.89). For all ADC metrics, manually and nnUNet extracted ADC were statistically equivalent (p<0.01). nnUNet identified one area of glioma infiltration missed by human observers. In 0.8% gliomas, nnUnet missed glioma components. In 6% of cases, over-segmentation of brain remote from the tumor occurred (e.g. temporal poles). The T2w trained nnUnet algorithm achieved ADC readouts for IDH genotyping with a performance statistically equivalent to human observers.

Tailoring task arithmetic to address bias in models trained on multi-institutional datasets.,40494422,Trevor Cohen,University of Washington,Department of Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education,"Multi-institutional datasets are widely used for machine learning from clinical data, to increase dataset size and improve generalization. However, deep learning models in particular may learn to recognize the source of a data element, leading to biased predictions. For example, deep learning models for image recognition trained on chest radiographs with COVID-19 positive and negative examples drawn from different data sources can respond to indicators of provenance (e.g., radiological annotations outside the lung area per institution-specific practices) rather than pathology, generalizing poorly beyond their training data. Bias of this sort, called confounding by provenance, is of concern in natural language processing (NLP) because provenance indicators (e.g., institution-specific section headers, or region-specific dialects) are pervasive in language data. Prior work on addressing such bias has focused on statistical methods, without providing a solution for deep learning models for NLP. Recent work in representation learning has shown that representing the weights of a trained deep network as task vectors allows for their arithmetic composition to govern model capabilities towards desired behaviors. In this work, we evaluate the extent to which reducing a model's ability to distinguish between contributing sites with such task arithmetic can mitigate confounding by provenance. To do so, we propose two model-agnostic methods, Task Arithmetic for Provenance Effect Reduction (TAPER) and Dominance-Aligned Polarized Provenance Effect Reduction (DAPPER), extending the task vectors approach to a novel problem domain. Evaluation on three datasets shows improved robustness to confounding by provenance for both RoBERTa and Llama-2 models with the task vector approach, with improved performance at the extremes of distribution shift. This work emphasizes the importance of adjusting for confounding by provenance, especially in extreme cases of the shift. In use of deep learning models, DAPPER and TAPER show efficiency in mitigating such bias. They provide a novel mitigation strategy for confounding by provenance, with broad applicability to address other sources of bias in composite clinical data sets.

T1-weighted imaging was used to assess volumetric alterations in different regions of the brain and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to examine microstructural damage in white matter. The pigs were imaged at 1- and 3-month post-injury. Neuropsychological screening for executive function and anxiety were performed before and in the months after the injury. The volumetric analysis showed significant longitudinal changes in pigs with mTBI compared with sham, which may be attributed to swelling and neuroinflammation. Fractional anisotropy (FA) values derived from DTI images demonstrated a 21% increase in corpus callosum from 1 to 3 months in mTBI pigs, which is significantly higher than in sham pigs (4.8%). Additionally, comparisons of the left and right internal capsules revealed a decrease in FA in the right internal capsule for mTBI pigs, which may indicate demyelination. The neuroimaging results suggest that the injury had disrupted the maturation of white and gray matter in the developing brain. Behavioral testing showed that compare to sham pigs, mTBI pigs exhibited 23% increased activity in open field tests, 35% incraesed escape attempts, along with a 65% decrease in interaction with the novel object, suggesting possible memory impairments and cognitive deficits. The correlation analysis showed an associations between volumetric features and behavioral metrics. Furthermore, a machine learning model, which integrated FA, volumetric features and behavioral test metrics, achieved 67% accuracy, indicating its potential to differentiate the two groups. Thus, the imaging biomarkers were indicative of long-term behavioral impairments and could be crucial to the clinical management of concussion in youth.",Cognition,Model,Imaging
Association of Psychological Resilience With Decelerated Brain Aging in Cognitively Healthy World Trade Center Responders.,40487784,Adriana Feder,Depression and Anxiety Center for Discovery and Treatment,Depression and Anxiety Center for Discovery and Treatment,"Despite their exposure to potentially traumatic stressors, the majority of World Trade Center (WTC) responders-those who worked on rescue, recovery, and cleanup efforts on or following September 11, 2001-have shown psychological resilience, never developing long-term psychopathology. Psychological resilience may be protective against the earlier age-related cognitive changes associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in this cohort. In the current study, we calculated the difference between estimated brain age from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and chronological age in WTC responders who participated in a parent functional MRI study of resilience (<i>N</i> = 97). We hypothesized that highly resilient responders would show the least brain aging and explored associations between brain aging and psychological and cognitive measures. WTC responders screened for the absence of cognitive impairment were classified into 3 groups: a WTC-related PTSD group (<i>n</i> = 32), a Highly Resilient group without lifetime psychopathology despite high WTC-related exposure (<i>n</i> = 34), and a Lower WTC-Exposed control group also without lifetime psychopathology (<i>n</i> = 31). We used <i>BrainStructureAges</i>, a deep learning algorithm that estimates voxelwise age from T1-weighted MRI data to calculate decelerated (or accelerated) brain aging relative to chronological age. Globally, brain aging was decelerated in the Highly Resilient group and accelerated in the PTSD group, with a significant group difference (<i>p</i> = .021, Cohen's <i>d</i> = 0.58); the Lower WTC-Exposed control group exhibited no significant brain age gap or group difference. Lesser brain aging was associated with resilience-linked factors including lower emotional suppression, greater optimism, and better verbal learning. Cognitively healthy WTC responders show differences in brain aging related to resilience and PTSD.",Resilience,BrainStructureAges,MRI
Investigation of brain white matter and social cognition in schizophrenia and schizotypal personality disorder using neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging.,40483322,Erin A Hazlett,Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,Department of Psychiatry,"Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is biologically and phenotypically similar to schizophrenia, but without frank psychosis and a general pattern of attenuated brain abnormalities. No studies have investigated the brain white matter in schizophrenia and SPD using neurite orientation dispersion density imaging (NODDI) to distinguish between intracellular vs. extracellular alterations to elucidate neurobiological mechanisms of resilience in the schizophrenia spectrum. In this study we used diffusion tensor imaging and NODDI to investigate putative white matter abnormalities common to schizophrenia (n = 42) and SPD (n = 31) compared to healthy controls (n = 40) and their relationship to social cognition. Individuals with schizophrenia had lower fractional anisotropy (FA) within the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and splenium of the corpus callosum compared to healthy controls. The SPD group had FA in these same regions that was intermediate to and significantly different from both groups. Group differences in FA could be attributed specifically to alterations in extracellular fiber coherence in contrast to intracellular neurite density. Lower FA was associated with worse ability to infer sarcasm both in the SPD and schizophrenia groups. These findings implicate attenuated (sparing of) putative white matter abnormalities in SPD in the same brain regions as schizophrenia and comparable structure-function relations in these patient groups. The finding that group differences in FA were driven by alterations in the orientational coherence of neurites suggests that it could serve as an intermediate phenotype in future diffusion imaging studies in the schizophrenia spectrum.",Schizophrenia,Unknown,NODDI

Predicting cognitive functioning in early psychosis: factors supporting and limiting generalizability of connectome-based models.,40475845,Hamdi Eryilmaz,Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School,Department of Psychiatry,"Cognitive impairment is a core, intractable aspect of psychotic disorders that impacts functional outcomes. Establishing reliable neural predictors of cognitive functioning at the individual level is an important goal of precision psychiatry and may accelerate personalized treatment development. Connectome-based predictive models (CPMs) have shown promise in identifying brain connectivity patterns that predict cognitive outcomes, however, such models do not produce accurate predictions for all individuals or groups, limiting their generalizability. Here, we used CPMs to identify brain network patterns predictive of cognitive functioning in patients with early psychosis and examined individual clinical and sociodemographic factors that may impact prediction accuracy. Leveraging the imaging data from the Human Connectome Project for Early Psychosis (HCP-EP; <i>N</i> = 93), we found that outcomes can be accurately predicted for general and fluid cognition. The generalizability of these models was assessed by predicting cognitive performance in an independent sample of patients (<i>N</i> = 20) with early psychosis, which revealed moderate accuracy but also sensitivity to the number of input features. Although predictive features were generally widespread, a virtual lesioning analysis showed that edges involving the default mode, retrosplenial and somatomotor networks contributed most to the prediction of individual differences in cognition. Finally, dissecting the causes of model failure suggested that sociodemographic and clinical factors that are stereotypically associated with cognitive ability in early psychosis contribute to misprediction particularly in participants who do not fit this stereotypical association. Our findings suggest that individual factors related to misprediction can inform and potentially improve predictive models of cognition in early psychosis.",Psychosis,CPMs,Imaging
"The functional neurobiology of negative affective traits across regions, networks, signatures, and a machine learning multiverse.",40475558,T D Wager,Dartmouth College,N/A,"Understanding the neural basis of negative affective traits like neuroticism remains a critical challenge across psychology, neuroscience, and psychiatry. Here, we investigate which level of brain organization-regions, networks, or validated whole-brain machine-learning signatures-best explains negative affective traits in a community sample of 458 adults performing the two most widely used affective fMRI tasks, viewing emotional faces and scenes. Neuroticism could not be predicted from brain activity, with Bayesian evidence against all theory-guided neural measures. However, preregistered whole-brain models successfully decoded vulnerability to stress, a lower-level facet of neuroticism, with results replicating in a hold-out sample. The neural stress vulnerability pattern demonstrated good psychometric properties and indicated that negative affective traits are best represented by distributed whole-brain patterns related to domain-general stimulation rather than localized activity. Together with results from a comprehensive multiverse analysis across 14 traits and 1,176 models-available for exploration in an online app-the findings speak against simplistic neurobiological theories of negative affective traits, highlight a striking gap between predicting individual differences (<i>r</i><.35) and within-person emotional states (<i>r</i>=.88), and underscore the importance of aligning psychological constructs with neural measures at the appropriate level of granularity.",Neuroticism,Unknown,fMRI
Subgrouping autism and ADHD based on structural MRI population modelling centiles.,40468437,Richard A I Bethlehem,University of Cambridge,Department of Psychology,"Autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are two highly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental conditions with variable underlying neurobiology. Imaging studies have yielded varied results, and it is now clear that there is unlikely to be one characteristic neuroanatomical profile of either condition. Parsing this heterogeneity could allow us to identify more homogeneous subgroups, either within or across conditions, which may be more clinically informative. This has been a pivotal goal for neurodevelopmental research using both clinical and neuroanatomical features, though results thus far have again been inconsistent with regards to the number and characteristics of subgroups. Here, we use population modelling to cluster a multi-site dataset based on global and regional centile scores of cortical thickness, surface area and grey matter volume. We use HYDRA, a novel semi-supervised machine learning algorithm which clusters based on differences to controls and compare its performance to a traditional clustering approach. We identified distinct subgroups within autism and ADHD, as well as across diagnosis, often with opposite neuroanatomical alterations relatively to controls. These subgroups were characterised by different combinations of increased or decreased patterns of morphometrics. We did not find significant clinical differences across subgroups. Crucially, however, the number of subgroups and their membership differed vastly depending on chosen features and the algorithm used, highlighting the impact and importance of careful method selection. We highlight the importance of examining heterogeneity in autism and ADHD and demonstrate that population modelling is a useful tool to study subgrouping in autism and ADHD. We identified subgroups with distinct patterns of alterations relative to controls but note that these results rely heavily on the algorithm used and encourage detailed reporting of methods and features used in future studies.",Autism,HYDRA,Imaging

FEMA-Long: Modeling unstructured covariances for discovery of time-dependent effects in large-scale longitudinal datasets.,40463188,Anders M Dale,University of California San Diego,Department of Radiology,"Linear mixed-effects (LME) models are commonly used for analyzing longitudinal data. However, most applications of LME models rely on random intercepts or simple, e.g., stationary, covariance. Here, we extend the Fast and Efficient Mixed-Effects Algorithm (FEMA) and present FEMA-Long, a computationally tractable approach to flexibly modeling longitudinal covariance suitable for high-dimensional data. FEMA-Long can i) model unstructured covariance, ii) model non-linear fixed effects using splines, iii) discover time-dependent fixed effects with spline interactions, and iv) perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS) supporting discovery of time-dependent genetic effects. We applied FEMA-Long to perform a longitudinal GWAS with non-linear SNP-by-time interaction on length, weight, and body mass index of 68,273 infants with up to six measurements in the first year of life. We found dynamic patterns of random effects including time-varying heritability and correlations, as well as several genetic variants showing time-dependent effects, highlighting the applicability of FEMA-Long to enable novel discoveries.",Unknown,FEMA-Long,Unknown
Machine learning for classification of pediatric bipolar disorder with and without psychotic symptoms based on thalamic subregional structural volume.,40462037,Rongwang Yang,The Children's Hospital,Department of Child Psychology,"The thalamus plays a crucial role in sensory processing, emotional regulation, and cognitive functions, and its dysregulation may be implicated in psychosis. The aim of the present study was to examine the differences in thalamic subregional volumes between pediatric bipolar disorder patients with (P-PBD) and without psychotic symptoms (NP-PBD). Participants including 28 P-PBD, 26 NP-PBD, and 18 healthy controls (HCs) underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) scanning using a 3.0T MRI scanner. All T1-weighted imaging data were processed by FreeSurfer 7.4.0 software. The volumetric differences of thalamic subregions among three groups were compared by using analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) and post-hoc analyses. Additionally, we applied a standard support vector classification (SVC) model for pairwise comparison among the three groups to identify brain regions with significant volumetric differences. The ANCOVA revealed that significant volumetric differences were observed in the left pulvinar anterior (L_PuA) and left reuniens medial ventral (L_MV-re) thalamus among three groups. Post-hoc analysis revealed that patients with P-PBD exhibited decreased volumes in the L_PuA and L_MV-re when compared to the NP-PBD group and HCs, respectively. Furthermore, the SVC model revealed that the L_MV-re volume exhibited the best capacity to discriminate P-PBD from NP-PBD and HCs. The present findings demonstrated that reduced thalamic subregional volumes in the L_PuA and L_MV-re might be associated with psychotic symptoms in PBD.",Psychosis,SVC,MRI

Network homeostasis: functional brain network alterations and relapse in remitted late-life depression.,40442463,Carmen Andreescu,University of Pittsburgh,Department of Psychiatry,"Late-life depression (LLD) is highly recurrent and associated with disability and increased mortality. In this study, we aim to identify neurobiological factors that are prospectively associated with relapse risk in late-life depression. We recruited 145 older adults (age ≥ 60): 102 recently remitted LLD participants and 43 healthy comparisons. Participants underwent baseline MRI and evaluation of depression symptoms/status for up to 2 years. We evaluated intrinsic network connectivity for 111 participants (39 healthy comparisons, 47 stable remitted, 25 relapsed). Compared to healthy comparisons, LLD participants had lower connectivity within the somatomotor network and greater connectivity between the executive control and default mode networks (DMN). Lower connectivity of DMN to somatomotor and salience networks was associated with relapse. Overall, connectivity of relapse participants was more similar to healthy comparisons than connectivity of stable remitted participants was. We found robust differences in network functional connectivity between stable remitted and relapsed participants. We also found evidence of neural ""scarring,"" or persistent functional network differences at baseline in all participants with a history of depression. Alterations in DMN connectivity were observed most prominently. Notably, the network structure of relapsed participants was more similar to healthy comparisons than stable remitted participants. These findings indicate that remission is associated with persistent functional network alterations while vulnerability to relapse is associated with a failure to establish a new stable homeostatic functional network structure.",Depression,Unknown,MRI
Contrastive functional connectivity defines neurophysiology-informed symptom dimensions in major depression.,40441140,Yu Zhang,Lehigh University,Department of Bioengineering,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly heterogeneous, posing challenges for effective treatment due to complex interactions between clinical symptoms and neurobiological features. To address this, we apply contrastive principal-component analysis to fMRI-based resting-state functional connectivity, isolating disorder-specific variations by contrasting data from 233 MDD patients and 285 healthy controls. Subsequently, we use sparse canonical correlation analysis to identify two significant dimensions linking distinct brain circuits with clinical profiles. One dimension relates to an internalizing-externalizing symptom spectrum involving visual and limbic networks and is associated with cognitive task reaction times. The other dimension, linked to personality traits protective against depression (e.g., extraversion), is driven by dorsal attention network connections and correlates with cognitive control and psychomotor performance. This approach illuminates stable symptom dimensions and their neurophysiological underpinnings, aiding in precision phenotyping for MDD and supporting the development of targeted, individualized therapeutic strategies for mental health care.",Depression,Analysis,fMRI
InterpolAI: deep learning-based optical flow interpolation and restoration of biomedical images for improved 3D tissue mapping.,40437217,Denis Wirtz,Johns Hopkins University,Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering,"Recent advances in imaging and computation have enabled analysis of large three-dimensional (3D) biological datasets, revealing spatial composition, morphology, cellular interactions and rare events. However, the accuracy of these analyses is limited by image quality, which can be compromised by missing data, tissue damage or low resolution due to mechanical, temporal or financial constraints. Here, we introduce InterpolAI, a method for interpolation of synthetic images between pairs of authentic images in a stack of images, by leveraging frame interpolation for large image motion, an optical flow-based artificial intelligence (AI) model. InterpolAI outperforms both linear interpolation and state-of-the-art optical flow-based method XVFI, preserving microanatomical features and cell counts, and image contrast, variance and luminance. InterpolAI repairs tissue damages and reduces stitching artifacts. We validated InterpolAI across multiple imaging modalities, species, staining techniques and pixel resolutions.

"Cortical myelin mapping in antipsychotic medication-naïve, first-episode psychosis patients.",40410588,Nina V Kraguljac,University of Alabama at Birmingham,Department of Psychology,"While white matter myelin primarily functions to accelerate conduction velocity and has been extensively studied in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (SSD), less is known about the role of gray matter myelin in SSD. Cortical myelination occurs mostly on the proximal axons of parvalbumin positive (PV+) interneurons, where it assists in trophic support and experience-dependent plasticity. Given the role of PV+ interneuron dysfunction in SSD, it is critical to advance our understanding of cortical myelin pathology in this context. Here, we quantified myelin maps using the T1w/T2w ratio in a large group of antipsychotic medication-naïve, first-episode psychosis patients. We compared myelin content between patients (N = 91) and controls (N = 107) using a MANCOVA and calculated zero-order correlations with the discriminant function for each region, then used a machine learning approach to identify the most parsimonious constellation of cortical regions driving group differences using a stepwise algorithm. Group membership was significantly associated with T1w/T2w ratio (Wilks Lambda = 0.09, p < 0.01), where patients had higher myelin values compared to healthy controls. We identified a subset of 16 regions, primarily located in association cortices, that were sufficient to explain group differences. Here, we report an increase in the cortical T1w/T2w ratio in association cortices in first-episode psychosis. We suggest that faulty myelin compaction during this critical developmental period could contribute to PV+ interneuron pathology and cortical microcircuit disruptions resulting in the clinical phenotype. With additional empirical support from future studies, novel treatment strategies targeting cortical myelin could have potential to mitigate circuit dysfunction in the illness.",Schizophrenia,Unknown,MRI

Investigating Social Network Peer Effects on HIV Care Engagement Using a Fuzzy-Like Matching Approach: Cross-Sectional Secondary Analysis of the N2 Cohort Study.,40338201,John A Schneider,University of Chicago,Department of Medicine,"Social network data are essential and informative for public health research and implementation as they provide details on individuals and their social context. For example, health information and behaviors, such as HIV-related prevention and care, may disseminate within a network or across society. By harmonizing egocentric and digital networks, researchers may construct a sociocentric-like ""fuzzy"" network based on a subgroup of the population. We aimed to generate a more complete sociocentric-like ""fuzzy"" network by harmonizing alternative sources of egocentric and digital network data to examine relationships between participants in the Neighborhoods and Networks (N2) cohort study. Further, we examined network peer effects of the status-neutral HIV care continuum cascade. Data were collected from January 2018 to December 2019 in Chicago, Illinois, United States, from a community health center and via peer referral sampling as part of the N2 cohort study, comprised of Black sexually minoritized men and gender expansive populations. Participants provided sociodemographics, social networks, sexual networks, mobile phone contacts, and Facebook friends list data. Lab-based information about the HIV care continuum cascade was also collected. We used an experimental approach to develop and test a fuzzy matching algorithm to construct a more complete network across social, sexual, phone, and Facebook networks using R and Excel. We calculated social network centrality measures for each of these networks and then described the HIV care continuum within the context of each network. We then used Spearman correlation and a network autocorrelation model to examine social network peer effects with HIV status and care engagement. A total of 412 participants resulted in 2054 network connections (ties) across the confidant and sexual partner social networks (participants=387; ties=445), peer referral network (participants=412; ties=362), phone contacts (participants=273; ties=362), and Facebook network (participants=144; ties=1383), reaching the entire study sample in one fully connected ""fuzzy"" network. Results from the individual networks' autocorrelation model suggest there are no peer effects on status-neutral HIV care engagement. Results from the final fuzzy-like sociocentric network autocorrelation model, adjusted for HIV serostatus, suggest that participants who were proximate to network members engaged in HIV care were significantly more likely to be engaged in care (ρ=0.128, SE 0.064; P=.045). Using alternative sources of network data allowed us to fuzzy match a more complete network: fuzzy matching may identify hidden ties among participants that were missed by examining alternative sources of network data separately. Although sociocentric studies require significant resources to implement, more complete sociocentric-like networks may be generated using a fuzzy match approach that leverages egocentric, peer referral, and digital networks. Enriching offline networks with digital network data may provide insights into characteristics and norms that egocentric approaches may not be able to capture.",HIV,Unknown,Unknown

RCTs that recruited people of any age with a diagnosis of a mental disorder and that tested the efficacy of any pharmacologic intervention vs any control arm. Random-effects logit-transformed proportion meta-analyses were used to estimate prevalence rates of race and ethnicity groups and their temporal trends across RCTs and to compare US RCT prevalence rates with US Census data. The Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of Reviews was used to report our review. Reporting of data and percentages of race and ethnicity. The year of publication, type of RCT, geographic location, age group, and sample size were also included. There were no deviations that occurred from the original protocol.

In US RCTs, adults in the other or multiracial and multiethnic category were historically overrepresented, while adults in Asian, Black, Hispanic among White, and White including Hispanic categories were underrepresented; Asian, Black, and Hispanic among White children and adolescents are still currently underrepresented. The findings of this meta-analysis suggest that differences in reporting race and ethnicity across geographic locations and underrepresentation of certain racial and ethnic groups in US-based RCTs highlight the need for international guidelines to ensure equitable recruitment and reporting in clinical trials.",Mental,Unknown,Unknown

Our goal was to facilitate more precise screening, early detection, and personalized prevention strategies, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes and promoting health equity. Deidentified electronic health record data from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III was used to identify patients with 4 types of cancer who had longitudinal hospital visits prior to their diagnosis presence. Their records were matched and combined with those of patients without cancer diagnoses using propensity scores based on demographic factors. Three advanced models, penalized logistic regression, random forest, and multilayer perceptron (MLP), were conducted to identify the rank of risk factors for each cancer type, with feature importance analysis for random forest and MLP models. The rank biased overlap was adopted to compare the similarity of ranked risk factors across cancer types. Our framework evaluated the prediction performance of explainable machine learning models, with the MLP model demonstrating the best performance. It achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.78 for breast cancer (n=58), 0.76 for colorectal cancer (n=140), 0.84 for lung cancer (n=398), and 0.78 for prostate cancer (n=104), outperforming other baseline models (P<.001). In addition to demographic risk factors, the most prominent nontraditional risk factors overlapped across models and cancer types, including hyperlipidemia (odds ratio [OR] 1.14, 95% CI 1.11-1.17; P<.01), diabetes (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.29-1.39; P<.01), depressive disorders (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06-1.16; P<.01), heart diseases (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.32-1.52; P<.01), and anemia (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.14-1.30; P<.01). The similarity analysis indicated the unique risk factor pattern for lung cancer from other cancer types. The study's findings demonstrated the effectiveness of explainable ML models in assessing nontraditional risk factors for major cancers and highlighted the importance of considering unique risk profiles for different cancer types. Moreover, this research served as a hypothesis-generating foundation, providing preliminary results for future investigation into cancer diagnosis risk analysis and management. Furthermore, expanding collaboration with clinical experts for external validation would be essential to refine model outputs, integrate findings into practice, and enhance their impact on patient care and cancer prevention efforts.",Depression,MLP,Unknown
Machine learning approaches for fine-grained symptom estimation in schizophrenia: A comprehensive review.,40305920,Ioannis Patras,Queen Mary University of London,N/A,"Schizophrenia is a severe yet treatable mental disorder, and it is diagnosed using a multitude of primary and secondary symptoms. Diagnosis and treatment for each individual depends on the severity of the symptoms. Therefore, there is a need for accurate, personalised assessments. However, the process can be both time-consuming and subjective; hence, there is a motivation to explore automated methods that can offer consistent diagnosis and precise symptom assessments, thereby complementing the work of healthcare practitioners. Machine Learning has demonstrated impressive capabilities across numerous domains, including medicine; the use of Machine Learning in patient assessment holds great promise for healthcare professionals and patients alike, as it can lead to more consistent and accurate symptom estimation. This survey reviews methodologies utilising Machine Learning for diagnosing and assessing schizophrenia. Contrary to previous reviews that primarily focused on binary classification, this work recognises the complexity of the condition and, instead, offers an overview of Machine Learning methods designed for fine-grained symptom estimation. We cover multiple modalities, namely Medical Imaging, Electroencephalograms and Audio-Visual, as the illness symptoms can manifest in a patient's pathology and behaviour. Finally, we analyse the datasets and methodologies used in the studies and identify trends, gaps, as opportunities for future research.",Schizophrenia,Unknown,Imaging
