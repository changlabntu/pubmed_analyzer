"Decoding HIV Discourse on Social Media: Large-Scale Analysis of 191,972 Tweets Using Machine Learning, Topic Modeling, and Temporal Analysis.",40882217,Angel B Algarin,Edson College of Nursing and Health Innovation,Edson College of Nursing and Health Innovation,"HIV remains a global challenge, with stigma, financial constraints, and psychosocial barriers preventing people living with HIV from accessing health care services, driving them to seek information and support on social media. Despite the growing role of digital platforms in health communication, existing research often narrowly focuses on specific HIV-related topics rather than offering a broader landscape of thematic patterns. In addition, much of the existing research lacks large-scale analysis and predominantly predates COVID-19 and the platform's transition to X (formerly known as Twitter), limiting our understanding of the comprehensive, dynamic, and postpandemic HIV-related discourse. This study aims to (1) observe the dominant themes in current HIV-related social media discourse, (2) explore similarities and differences between theory-driven (eg, literature-informed predetermined categories) and data-driven themes (eg, unsupervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation [LDA] without previous categorization), and (3) examine how emotional responses and temporal patterns influence the dissemination of HIV-related content. We analyzed 191,972 tweets collected between June 2023 and August 2024 using an integrated analytical framework. This approach combined: (1) supervised machine learning for text classification, (2) comparative topic modeling with both theory-driven and data-driven LDA to identify thematic patterns, (3) sentiment analysis using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) and the NRC Emotion Lexicon to examine emotional dimensions, and (4) temporal trend analysis to track engagement patterns. Theory-driven themes revealed that information and education content constituted the majority of HIV-related discourse (120,985/191,972, 63.02%), followed by opinions and commentary (23,863/191,972, 12.43%), and personal experiences and stories (19,672/191,972, 10.25%). The data-driven approach identified 8 distinct themes, some of which shared similarities with aspects from the theory-driven approach, while others were unique. Temporal analysis revealed 2 different engagement patterns: official awareness campaigns like World AIDS Day generated delayed peak engagement through top-down information sharing, while community-driven events like National HIV Testing Day showed immediate user engagement through peer-to-peer interactions. HIV-related social media discourse on X reflects the dominance of informational content, the emergence of prevention as a distinct thematic focus, and the varying effectiveness of different timing patterns in HIV-related messaging. These findings suggest that effective HIV communication strategies can integrate medical information with community perspectives, maintain balanced content focus, and strategically time messages to maximize engagement. These insights provide valuable guidance for developing digital outreach strategies that better connect healthcare services with vulnerable populations in the post-COVID-19 pandemic era."
Social Media Insights Into Disease Burden in Patients and Caregivers of Myelodysplastic Syndrome: Subcohort Analysis of High-Risk Patients.,40844074,Cosmina Hogea,Gilead Sciences Inc,N/A,"Social media platforms offer valuable insights into patients' experience, revealing organic conversations that reflect their immediate concerns and needs. Through active listening to lived experiences, we can identify unmet needs and discover the real-world challenges that patients and caregivers face. The aim of our study is to develop a reusable framework to collect and analyze evolving social media data, capturing insights into the experiences of individuals with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and higher-risk MDS and their caregivers. The findings can inform the development of appropriate patient support interventions. We conducted a structured Google search of English-language websites relevant to MDS from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2022, using validated URLs and keywords. Data were sourced from MDS-specific platforms to ensure clinical relevance. Contextual embeddings (rather than simple keyword matching) were applied to detect semantically meaningful mentions of ""MDS."" Scraping algorithms collected, cleaned, and standardized the data. Posts were classified as originating from patients or caregivers using decision-tree tagging based on contextual summaries. Users were categorized as HR-MDS based on explicit mentions of ""high-risk"" or by referencing criteria aligned with National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines (eg, blast count, transplant, chemotherapy use). Each post was analyzed for major themes and sentiment using a supervised machine learning classifier, while latent topics were identified through a semisupervised model. We analyzed ~5.5 million words from 42,000 posts across 5500 threads by ~4000 users from the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. Of the 1249 HR-MDS users identified, 587 (47%) were patients and 662 (53%) were caregivers. Dominant sentiments among HR-MDS users included concern (n=974, 78%), anxiety (n=749, 60%), frustration (n=724, 58%), fear (n=724, 58%), and confusion (n=612, 49%). Concern was the top sentiment among caregivers (n=390, 59%), while anxiety led among patients (n=323, 55%). Key topics included blood counts (n=674, 54%), disease burden (n=537, 43%), quality of life (n=450, 36%), treatment options (n=387, 31%), and disease progression (n=387, 31%). Anxiety was frequently tied to health (n=600, 48%), treatment (n=325, 26%), and the diagnostic process (n=250, 20%). Fear stemmed from complications (n=237, 19%) and progression (n=240, 19%). Confusion about diagnosis and disease understanding was reported by 300 (24%). Information-seeking behaviors revealed user interest in treatment interventions (n=238, 19%) and ongoing research (n=212, 17%). The application of sophisticated natural language processing techniques demonstrates promise in effectively identifying the emerging complex themes and sentiments experienced by HR-MDS users, thereby highlighting the unmet needs, barriers, and facilitators associated with the disease."
Use of Mobile Sensing Data for Longitudinal Monitoring and Prediction of Depression Severity: Systematic Review.,40839863,Hanna Reich,University Hospital,Department for Psychiatry,"Depression is highly recurrent and heterogeneous. The unobtrusive, continuous collection of mobile sensing data via smartphones and wearable devices offers a promising approach to monitor and predict individual depression trajectories, distinguish illness states, and anticipate changes in symptom severity. This systematic review evaluates whether objective data from wearable devices and smartphones can (1) monitor and distinguish different states of depression, (2) predict changes in symptom severity, and (3) identify clinically relevant objective features for tracking and forecasting depression within diagnosed individuals. We searched PubMed and Web of Science databases for English-language studies (published 2012-2022) that used smartphone or wearable device data, included participants aged ≥14 years with a depression diagnosis, and collected continuous data for at least 12 weeks. Out of 12,997 peer-reviewed articles, 9 original studies met the inclusion criteria, with sample sizes ranging from 45 to 2200 and durations of 12-52 weeks. Of the 9 studies, 3 used smartphone data, 1 used wearable device data, and 5 used both data types. Commonly collected variables were step count, distance moved, smartphone usage, call logs, sleep, heart rate, light exposure, and speech patterns. One study (11%) successfully differentiated between depressive states (worsening, relapse, or recovery). Six studies (67%) showed that mobile sensing data could predict depressive episodes or symptom severity. Four studies reported the predictive accuracy for depression using mobile sensing data from smartphones and wearable devices, ranging from 81% to 91%. Higher accuracy was achieved with personalized models or multimodal data. Real-time passive monitoring via wearable devices and smartphones holds promise for personalized self-management, but key gaps remain, such as a lack of longitudinal and long-term studies with data collection for 1 year or longer, studies with confirmatory parameters on an individual level, and studies with a strong correlation between parameters in individual patients to support clinical decision-making. Improvements in reporting standards are highly recommended to provide better-informed insights for clinicians. Throughout this process, there is a clear need to address various other issues, such as limited types of collected data, reliability, user adherence, and privacy concerns.

"Exploring the Perspectives of Pediatric Health Care Providers, Youth Patients, and Caregivers on Machine Learning Suicide Risk Classification: Mixed Methods Study.",40829141,Emily E Haroz,Johns Hopkins University,Department of Mental Health,"Suicide was the second leading cause of death for youth aged between 10 and 24 years in 2023, necessitating improved risk identification to better identify those in need of support. While machine learning (ML) applied to electronic health records shows promise in improving risk identification, further research on the perspectives of these tools is needed to better inform implementation strategies. These findings incorporate 2 studies aimed to explore patient, caregiver, and pediatric health care provider perspectives on suicide risk models and associated clinical practices. We sought to use these findings to inform the design and implementation of a suicide risk model and associated clinical workflow to improve the quality of care provided to at-risk youth. We conducted a convergent mixed methods study to evaluate pediatric provider perspectives by quantitatively surveying and qualitatively interviewing provider participants. The provider study was guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, and data were analyzed descriptively and using a template analysis for quantitative and qualitative data, respectively. Qualitative interviews conducted among youth patients and caregivers as part of a sequential mixed methods study, guided by the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability, were analyzed using template analysis as well. The integration of quantitative and qualitative data was achieved through a joint display, and results were interpreted through a narrative review. Forty-five providers completed the first section of the survey (risk model clinical preferences), while 44 completed the second section (risk model usability perspectives) and 38 completed the third section (Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research barriers and facilitators). Eight pediatric providers were interviewed. Ten semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted among 9 patient participants aged between 8 and 25 years and 1 caregiver. Overall, providers, patients, and caregivers expressed interest in applying ML methods to improve suicide risk identification. Providers felt that these tools could address current challenges in suicide-related care, such as inadequacies in manual suicide screeners or communication across care teams. Patients and caregivers saw potential for these tools to facilitate discussions regarding suicide and promote early intervention for patients who might otherwise be missed by current care practices. However, providers also expressed concerns about increased demand for mental health services, implications for patient confidentiality, coercive care, inaccurate diagnosis and response, and medical-legal liability. Ethical concerns shared by patients and caregivers spanned data safety practices and privacy regulations, respect for patient autonomy and informed consent, and decreased future health care engagement due to poor implementation. There is conditional acceptability and enthusiasm among providers, patients, and caregivers for ML-based suicide risk models. Successful implementation requires the incorporation of provider perspectives in a user-led fashion to build trust and empower clinicians to respond appropriately to risk flags, while upholding youth and caregiver perspectives to adequately accommodate patient needs."
Machine learning approaches to predicting medication nonadherence: a scoping review.,40819415,Jeffery Talbert,University of Kentucky College of Medicine,University of Kentucky College of Medicine,"Medication nonadherence is a common, preventable cause of adverse clinical outcomes. Predictive models identifying risk of nonadherence could enable proactive intervention. This scoping review aimed to describe relevant predictors, model training and evaluation processes, and how adherence was classified to inform implementation of clinically actionable models. A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science was conducted for studies published between January 2015 and December 2024 describing creation of models predictive of future medication adherence using machine learning methods. Conference abstracts, review articles, study protocols, or full text articles unavailable to authors were excluded. Data was extracted and study risk of bias assessed by an investigator-specified scale. Quantitative analysis was performed in studies reporting area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), analyzing characteristics of the model with the highest reported AUC (""primary model"") per study. 52 studies were included, of which 14 were considered low risk of bias, 34 moderate, and 4 high. 9 did not report AUC and were excluded from quantitative analysis. Adherence was most frequently assessed using indirect, dispense history-based methods such as proportion of days covered. Primary models incorporating diagnostic or subject-reported data had higher median AUC (diagnostic 0.837; subject-reported 0.828; overall 0.82). Common important predictors included the Beliefs about Medicines questionnaire, comorbidities, medication history, prior adherence and socioeconomic factors. Random forest and logistic regression models were identified as the highest performing models most frequently. Approaches to modeling and evaluating adherence prediction were highly variable, however several successful algorithms, predictors, and training techniques were identified. Future research should prioritize operational feasibility and clinical utility in development of predictive models to ensure creation of effective clinical decision support tools."
The sleep-anxiety dysregulation model of alcohol use disorder risk: A nine-year longitudinal machine learning study.,40774510,Natalia Van Doren,University of California at San Francisco,Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences,"Sleep disturbances are a known risk factor for alcohol use, yet their long-term predictive value for alcohol use disorder (AUD)-especially in the context of co-occurring anxiety symptoms-remains understudied. The present study thus applied machine learning with internal validation to evaluate how sleep disturbances predict nine-year AUD symptoms in midlife adults. It also introduces the Sleep-Anxiety Dysregulation Model of AUD Risk, which posits that sleep and anxiety symptoms confer shared vulnerability via disrupted arousal regulation. Community-dwelling midlife adults (N = 1,054) completed clinical interviews, self-reports, and a seven-day actigraphy protocol to assess demographics, psychiatric symptoms, anxiety severity, subjective sleep, and objective actigraphy sleep indices. A five-fold nested cross-validated random forest identified potentially nonlinear and interactive predictors. The baseline model included 41 variables. The final multivariable model explained over two-fifths of the variance in nine-year AUD symptoms (R<sup>2</sup> = 42.7%, 95% confidence intervals [40.1%-45.8%]). Key baseline predictors of nine-year AUD severity included lower rest-stage activity, sleep discontinuity and fragmentation patterns, and decreased active wake-stage physical movement. Other baseline predictors comprised younger age, higher generalized anxiety disorder, major depression, and panic disorder severity. No subjective sleep disturbances predicted nine-year AUD symptoms. Results underscore the shared contribution of sleep and anxiety disturbances to long-term AUD risk. The proposed Sleep-Anxiety Dysregulation Model of AUD Risk offers an integrative framework suggesting that AUD symptoms may emerge via chronic arousal dysregulation, including heightened physiological reactivity. Externally validating this model may inform preventive strategies targeting distal risk processes underlying AUD."
Towards large language models with human-like episodic memory.,40713240,Sebastian Michelmann,New York University,Department of Psychology,"Cognitive neuroscience research has made tremendous progress over the past decade in addressing how episodic memory (EM; memory for unique past experiences) supports our ability to understand real-world events. Despite this progress, we still lack a computational modeling framework that is able to generate precise predictions regarding how EM will be used when processing high-dimensional naturalistic stimuli. Recent work in machine learning that augments large language models (LLMs) with external memory could potentially accomplish this, but current popular approaches are misaligned with human memory in various ways. This review surveys these differences, suggests criteria for benchmark tasks to promote alignment with human EM, and ends with potential methods to evaluate predictions from memory-augmented models using neuroimaging techniques."
Using Machine Learning of Online Expression to Explain Recovery Trajectories: Content Analytic Approach to Studying a Substance Use Disorder Forum.,37606984,Dhavan Shah,University of Wisconsin-Madison,Department of Psychology,"Smartphone-based apps are increasingly used to prevent relapse among those with substance use disorders (SUDs). These systems collect a wealth of data from participants, including the content of messages exchanged in peer-to-peer support forums. How individuals self-disclose and exchange social support in these forums may provide insight into their recovery course, but a manual review of a large corpus of text by human coders is inefficient. The study sought to evaluate the feasibility of applying supervised machine learning (ML) to perform large-scale content analysis of an online peer-to-peer discussion forum. Machine-coded data were also used to understand how communication styles relate to writers' substance use and well-being outcomes. Data were collected from a smartphone app that connects patients with SUDs to online peer support via a discussion forum. Overall, 268 adult patients with SUD diagnoses were recruited from 3 federally qualified health centers in the United States beginning in 2014. Two waves of survey data were collected to measure demographic characteristics and study outcomes: at baseline (before accessing the app) and after 6 months of using the app. Messages were downloaded from the peer-to-peer forum and subjected to manual content analysis. These data were used to train supervised ML algorithms using features extracted from the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) system to automatically identify the types of expression relevant to peer-to-peer support. Regression analyses examined how each expression type was associated with recovery outcomes. Our manual content analysis identified 7 expression types relevant to the recovery process (emotional support, informational support, negative affect, change talk, insightful disclosure, gratitude, and universality disclosure). Over 6 months of app use, 86.2% (231/268) of participants posted on the app's support forum. Of these participants, 93.5% (216/231) posted at least 1 message in the content categories of interest, generating 10,503 messages. Supervised ML algorithms were trained on the hand-coded data, achieving F<sub>1</sub>-scores ranging from 0.57 to 0.85. Regression analyses revealed that a greater proportion of the messages giving emotional support to peers was related to reduced substance use. For self-disclosure, a greater proportion of the messages expressing universality was related to improved quality of life, whereas a greater proportion of the negative affect expressions was negatively related to quality of life and mood. This study highlights a method of natural language processing with potential to provide real-time insights into peer-to-peer communication dynamics. First, we found that our ML approach allowed for large-scale content coding while retaining moderate-to-high levels of accuracy. Second, individuals' expression styles were associated with recovery outcomes. The expression types of emotional support, universality disclosure, and negative affect were significantly related to recovery outcomes, and attending to these dynamics may be important for appropriate intervention."
Longitudinal Digital Phenotyping of Multiple Sclerosis Severity Using Passively Sensed Behaviors and Ecological Momentary Assessments: Real-World Evaluation.,40459924,Mayank Goel,Carnegie Mellon University,School of Computer Science,"Longitudinal tracking of multiple sclerosis (MS) symptoms in an individual's environment may improve self-monitoring and clinical management for people with MS. Conventional symptom tracking methods rely on self-reports and clinical visits, which can be infrequent, subjective, and burdensome. Digital phenotyping using passively collected sensor data from smartphones and fitness trackers offers a promising alternative for continuous, real-time symptom monitoring with minimal patient burden. We aimed to develop and evaluate a machine learning (ML)-based digital phenotyping approach to monitor the severity of clinically-relevant MS symptoms. We used passive sensing data to predict short-term fluctuations in patient-reported symptoms, including depressive symptoms, global MS symptom burden, severe fatigue, and poor sleep quality. Further, we examined the impact of incorporating behavioral context features and ecological momentary assessments on prediction performance. We conducted a 12- to 24-week longitudinal study involving 104 people with MS, collecting passive sensor and behavioral health data. Smartphone sensors recorded call activity, location, and screen use, while fitness trackers captured heart rate, sleep patterns, and step count. We extracted patient-level behavioral features and categorized them into 2 feature sets: one from the prediction period (called action) and one from the preceding period (called context). Using an ML pipeline based on support vector machines and AdaBoost, we evaluated the predictive performance of sensor-based models, both with and without ecological momentary assessment inputs. Between November 16, 2019, and January 24, 2021, overall, 104 people with MS (women: n=88, 84.6%; non-Hispanic White: n=97, 93.3%; mean age 44, SD 11.8 years) from a clinic-based cohort completed 12 weeks of data collection, including a subset of 44 participants (women: n=39, 89%; non-Hispanic White: n=42, 95%; mean age 45.7, SD 11.2 years) who completed 24 weeks of data collection. In total, we collected approximately 12,500 days of passive sensor and behavioral health data from the participants. Among the best-performing models with the least sensor data requirement, the ML algorithm predicted depressive symptoms with an accuracy of 80.6% (F<sub>1</sub>-score=0.76), high global MS symptom burden with an accuracy of 77.3% (F<sub>1</sub>-score=0.78), severe fatigue with an accuracy of 73.8% (F<sub>1</sub>-score=0.74), and poor sleep quality with an accuracy of 72.0% (F<sub>1</sub>-score=0.70). Further, sensor data were largely sufficient for predicting symptom severity, while the prediction of depressive symptoms benefited from minimal active patient input in the form of responses to 2 brief questions on the day before the prediction point. Our digital phenotyping approach using passive sensors on smartphones and fitness trackers may help patients with real-world, continuous self-monitoring of common symptoms in their own environment and assist clinicians with better triage of patient needs for timely interventions in MS and potentially other chronic neurological disorders."
Multiband EEG signatures decoded using machine learning for predicting rTMS treatment response in MDD.,40441660,Yu Zhang,Lehigh University,Department of Bioengineering,"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a promising treatment for major depression disorder (MDD), particularly for treatment-resistant cases. However, identifying translatable biomarkers predictive of treatment outcomes remains underexplored. Participants with treatment resistant depression from the TDBRAIN dataset underwent either high frequency rTMS (10 Hz) at the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (Protocol 1, n = 44) or low frequency rTMS (1 Hz) at the right DLPFC (Protocol 2, n = 73). Pre-treatment electroencephalograms (EEG) was collected, and changes in Beck Depression Inventory were measured post-treatment. EEG oscillations were decomposed into multiband intrinsic mode functions (IMF) and integrated under a latent space predictive modeling framework to identify signatures for predicting treatment outcomes. Multiband signatures significantly predicted rTMS outcomes (Protocol 1: r = 0.40, p < 0.01; Protocol 2: r = 0.26, p < 0.05). Key spatial patterns linked to treatment outcomes were identified, revealing three main oscillations: IMF-Alpha, IMF-Beta, and the residual signal. In Protocol 1, critical regions included the left frontal and parietal regions for IMF-Alpha, left frontal-central and right parietal regions for IMF-Beta, and bi-hemispheric central and left parietal-occipital regions for residual signals. In Protocol 2, critical regions involved the left frontal and parietal regions for IMF-Alpha, left frontal-central region IMF-Beta, and right frontal, left frontal-central, midline central, and left parietal-occipital regions for residual signals. These oscillatory features also showed correlations with specific personality measures, suggesting their potential clinical relevance. Our findings demonstrate the promise of machine learning-driven multiband EEG signatures for personalized MDD treatment prediction, offering a translatable pathway for improved patient outcomes."
Deep learning-based classification of posttraumatic stress disorder and depression following trauma utilizing visual and auditory markers of arousal and mood.,32744201,Isaac R Galatzer-Levy,New York University Grossman School of Medicine,Department of Psychiatry,"Visual and auditory signs of patient functioning have long been used for clinical diagnosis, treatment selection, and prognosis. Direct measurement and quantification of these signals can aim to improve the consistency, sensitivity, and scalability of clinical assessment. Currently, we investigate if machine learning-based computer vision (CV), semantic, and acoustic analysis can capture clinical features from free speech responses to a brief interview 1 month post-trauma that accurately classify major depressive disorder (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). N = 81 patients admitted to an emergency department (ED) of a Level-1 Trauma Unit following a life-threatening traumatic event participated in an open-ended qualitative interview with a para-professional about their experience 1 month following admission. A deep neural network was utilized to extract facial features of emotion and their intensity, movement parameters, speech prosody, and natural language content. These features were utilized as inputs to classify PTSD and MDD cross-sectionally. Both video- and audio-based markers contributed to good discriminatory classification accuracy. The algorithm discriminates PTSD status at 1 month after ED admission with an AUC of 0.90 (weighted average precision = 0.83, recall = 0.84, and f1-score = 0.83) as well as depression status at 1 month after ED admission with an AUC of 0.86 (weighted average precision = 0.83, recall = 0.82, and f1-score = 0.82). Direct clinical observation during post-trauma free speech using deep learning identifies digital markers that can be utilized to classify MDD and PTSD status."
Functional connectome-based predictive modeling of suicidal ideation.,40441623,Chadi G Abdallah,Baylor College of Medicine,Baylor College of Medicine,"Suicide represents an egregious threat to society despite major advancements in medicine, in part due to limited knowledge of the biological mechanisms of suicidal behavior. We apply a connectome predictive modeling machine learning approach to identify a reproducible brain network associated with suicidal ideation in the hopes of demonstrating possible targets for novel anti-suicidal therapeutics. Patients were recruited from an inpatient facility at The Menninger Clinic, in Houston, Texas (N = 261; 181 with active and specific suicidal ideation) and had a current major depressive episode and recurrent major depressive disorder, underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. The participants' ages ranged from 18 to 70 (mean ± SEM = 31.6 ± 0.8 years) and 136 (52 %) were males. Using this approach, we found a robust and reproducible biomarker of suicidal ideation relative to controls without ideation, showing that increased suicidal ideation was associated with greater internal connectivity and reduced internetwork external connectivity in the central executive, default mode, and dorsal salience networks. We also found evidence for higher external connectivity between ventral salience and sensorimotor/visual networks as being associated with increased suicidal ideation. Overall, these observed differences may reflect reduced network integration and higher segregation of connectivity in individuals with increased suicide risk. Our findings provide avenues for future work to test novel drugs targeting these identified neural alterations, for instance drugs that increase network integration."
Capitalizing on natural language processing (NLP) to automate the evaluation of coach implementation fidelity in guided digital cognitive-behavioral therapy (GdCBT).,40170669,Michelle G Newman,The Pennsylvania State University,Department of Psychology,"As the use of guided digitally-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy (GdCBT) grows, pragmatic analytic tools are needed to evaluate coaches' implementation fidelity. We evaluated how natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) methods might automate the monitoring of coaches' implementation fidelity to GdCBT delivered as part of a randomized controlled trial. Coaches served as guides to 6-month GdCBT with 3,381 assigned users with or at risk for anxiety, depression, or eating disorders. CBT-trained and supervised human coders used a rubric to rate the implementation fidelity of 13,529 coach-to-user messages. NLP methods abstracted data from text-based coach-to-user messages, and 11 ML models predicting coach implementation fidelity were evaluated. Inter-rater agreement by human coders was excellent (intra-class correlation coefficient = .980-.992). Coaches achieved behavioral targets at the start of the GdCBT and maintained strong fidelity throughout most subsequent messages. Coaches also avoided prohibited actions (e.g. reinforcing users' avoidance). Sentiment analyses generally indicated a higher frequency of coach-delivered positive than negative sentiment words and predicted coach implementation fidelity with acceptable performance metrics (e.g. area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 74.48%). The final best-performing ML algorithms that included a more comprehensive set of NLP features performed well (e.g. AUC = 76.06%). NLP and ML tools could help clinical supervisors automate monitoring of coaches' implementation fidelity to GdCBT. These tools could maximize allocation of scarce resources by reducing the personnel time needed to measure fidelity, potentially freeing up more time for high-quality clinical care."
Evaluating the ability of artificial intelligence to predict suicide: A systematic review of reviews.,40274119,Waguih William IsHak,Cedars-Sinai Health System,N/A,"Suicide remains a critical global public health issue, with approximately 800,000 deaths annually. Despite various prevention efforts, suicide rates are rising, highlighting the need for more effective strategies. Traditional suicide risk assessment methods often fall short in accuracy and predictive capability. This has driven interest in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (ML), as a potential solution. This paper reviews systematic evaluations of AI's effectiveness in predicting suicide risk, aiming to explore AI's potential while addressing its challenges and limitations. A meta-research approach was used to review existing systematic reviews on AI's role in suicide risk prediction. Following PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed and Web of Science for publications from 2004 to 2024. Relevant studies were selected based on specific inclusion criteria, and data were extracted on review characteristics, AI techniques, outcomes, and methodological quality. The review focuses on AI/ML models predicting suicidal ideation (SI), suicide attempts (SA), and suicide deaths (SD) separately, excluding non-suicidal self-injury. Out of 96 initial articles, 23 met the inclusion criteria for full-text review. Most studies focused on developing ML models to identify suicide risk, showing promising results in enhancing accuracy and effectiveness. These models utilize various data sources and analytical techniques. However, challenges remain, including high bias risk and issues with interpretability, which necessitate further validation and refinement of AI-driven methods. The review underscores the significant potential of AI, especially ML, in predicting suicide risk and attempts. Although ML models show promise, challenges like data limitations, bias, and interpretability issues need addressing. Continued research and ethical scrutiny are crucial to fully realize AI's potential in suicide prevention."
The Application of AI to Ecological Momentary Assessment Data in Suicide Research: Systematic Review.,40245396,Thomas Ellis Joiner,Florida State University,Psychology Department,"Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) captures dynamic processes suitable to the study of suicidal ideation and behaviors. Artificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly been applied to EMA data in the study of suicidal processes. This review aims to (1) synthesize empirical research applying AI strategies to EMA data in the study of suicidal ideation and behaviors; (2) identify methodologies and data collection procedures used, suicide outcomes studied, AI applied, and results reported; and (3) develop a standardized reporting framework for researchers applying AI to EMA data in the future. PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and Embase were searched for published articles applying AI to EMA data in the investigation of suicide outcomes. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were used to identify studies while minimizing bias. Quality appraisal was performed using CREMAS (adapted STROBE [Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology] Checklist for Reporting Ecological Momentary Assessment Studies). In total, 1201 records were identified across databases. After a full-text review, 12 (1%) articles, comprising 4398 participants, were included. In the application of AI to EMA data to predict suicidal ideation, studies reported mean area under the curve (0.74-0.86), sensitivity (0.64-0.81), specificity (0.73-0.86), and positive predictive values (0.72-0.77). Studies met between 4 and 13 of the 16 recommended CREMAS reporting standards, with an average of 7 items met across studies. Studies performed poorly in reporting EMA training procedures and treatment of missing data. Findings indicate the promise of AI applied to self-report EMA in the prediction of near-term suicidal ideation. The application of AI to EMA data within suicide research is a burgeoning area hampered by variations in data collection and reporting procedures. The development of an adapted reporting framework by the research team aims to address this.

An electroencephalographic signature predicts antidepressant response in major depression.,32042166,Amit Etkin,Stanford University,Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences,"Antidepressants are widely prescribed, but their efficacy relative to placebo is modest, in part because the clinical diagnosis of major depression encompasses biologically heterogeneous conditions. Here, we sought to identify a neurobiological signature of response to antidepressant treatment as compared to placebo. We designed a latent-space machine-learning algorithm tailored for resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) and applied it to data from the largest imaging-coupled, placebo-controlled antidepressant study (n = 309). Symptom improvement was robustly predicted in a manner both specific for the antidepressant sertraline (versus placebo) and generalizable across different study sites and EEG equipment. This sertraline-predictive EEG signature generalized to two depression samples, wherein it reflected general antidepressant medication responsivity and related differentially to a repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment outcome. Furthermore, we found that the sertraline resting-state EEG signature indexed prefrontal neural responsivity, as measured by concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation and EEG. Our findings advance the neurobiological understanding of antidepressant treatment through an EEG-tailored computational model and provide a clinical avenue for personalized treatment of depression."
Endometriosis Communities on Reddit: Quantitative Analysis.,40163844,Matthew Wilkens,Cornell University,Department of Information Science,"Endometriosis is a chronic condition that affects 10% of the people with a uterus. Due to the complex social and psychological impacts caused by this condition, people with endometriosis often turn to online health communities (OHCs) for support. Prior work identifies a lack of large-scale analyses of the experiences of patients with endometriosis and of OHCs. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating aspects of the condition and aggregate user needs that emerge from 2 endometriosis OHCs, r/Endo and r/endometriosis. We used latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling, an unsupervised machine learning method, to extract the subject matter (""topic"") of >30,000 posts and >300,000 comments. In addition to latent Dirichlet allocation, we leveraged supervised classification. Specifically, we fine-tuned a series of the DistilBERT models to identify the people and relationships (personas) a post mentions as well as the type of support that the post seeks (intent). Combining the results of these 2 methods, we identified associations between a post's topic, the personas mentioned, and the post's intent. The most discussed topics in posts were medical stories, medical appointments, sharing symptoms, menstruation, and empathy. Through the combination of the results from topic modeling and supervised classification, we found that when discussing medical appointments, users were more likely to mention the endometriosis OHCs than medical professionals. Medical professional was the least likely of any persona to be associated with empathy. Posts that mentioned partner or family were likely to discuss topics from the life issues category, particularly fertility. Users sought experiential knowledge regarding treatments and health care processes, and they also wished to vent and establish emotional connections about the life-altering aspects of the condition. We conclude that members of the OHCs need greater empathy within clinical settings, easier access to appointments, more information on care pathways, and more support for their loved ones. Endometriosis OHCs currently fulfill some of these needs as they provide members with a space where they can receive validation, discuss care pathways, and learn to manage symptoms. This study demonstrates the value of quantitative analyses of OHCs. Computational analyses can support and extend findings from small-scale studies about patient experiences and provide insights into hard-to-reach groups. Finally, we provide recommendations for clinical practice and medical training programs."
Using machine learning to identify features associated with different types of self-injurious behaviors in autistic youth.,40162513,Carla A Mazefsky,University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine,Department of Psychiatry,"Self-injurious behaviors (SIB) are common in autistic people. SIB is mainly studied as a broad category, rather than by specific SIB types. We aimed to determine associations of distinct SIB types with common psychiatric, emotional, medical, and socio-demographic factors. Participants included 323 autistic youth (~50% non-/minimally-speaking) with high-confidence autism diagnoses ages 4-21 years. Data were collected by the Autism Inpatient Collection during admission to a specialized psychiatric inpatient unit (www.sfari.org/resource/autism-inpatient-collection/). Caregivers completed questionnaires about their child, including SIB type and severity. The youth completed assessments with clinicians. Elastic net regressions identified associations between SIB types and factors. No single factor relates to all SIB types. SIB types have unique sets of associations. Consistent with previous work, more repetitive motor movements and lower adaptive skills are associated with most types of SIB; female sex is associated with hair/skin pulling and self-rubbing/scratching. More attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms are associated with self-rubbing/scratching, skin picking, hair/skin pulling, and inserts finger/object. Inserts finger/object has the most medical condition associations. Self-hitting against surface/object has the most emotion dysregulation associations. Specific SIB types have unique sets of associations. Future work can develop clinical likelihood scores for specific SIB types in inpatient settings, which can be tested with large community samples. Current approaches for SIB focus on the behavior functions, but there is an opportunity to further develop interventions by considering the specific SIB type in assessment and treatment. Identifying factors associated with specific SIB types may aid with screening, prevention, and treatment of these often-impairing behaviors."
Identifying the presence and timing of discrete mood states prior to therapy.,32135317,Hannah G Bosley,University of California,N/A,"The present study tested a novel, person-specific method for identifying discrete mood profiles from time-series data, and examined the degree to which these profiles could be predicted by lagged mood and anxiety variables and time-based variables, including trends (linear, quadratic, cubic), cycles (12-hr, 24-hr, and 7-day), day of the week, and time of day. We analyzed ambulatory data from 45 individuals with mood and anxiety disorders prior to therapy. Data were collected four-times-daily for at least 30 days. Latent profile analysis was applied person-by-person to discretize each individual's continuous multivariate time series of rumination, worry, fear, anger, irritability, anhedonia, hopelessness, depressed mood, and avoidance. That is, each time point was classified according to its unique blend of emotional states, and latent classes representing discrete mood profiles were identified for each participant. We found that the modal number of latent classes per person was three (mean = 3.04, median = 3), with a range of two to four classes. After splitting each individual's time series into random halves for training and testing, we used elastic net regularization to identify the temporal and lagged predictors of each mood profile's presence or absence in the training set. Prediction accuracy was evaluated in the testing set. Across 127 models, the average area under the curve was 0.77, with sensitivity of 0.81 and specificity of 0.75. Brier scores indicated an average prediction accuracy of 83%."
"Using natural language processing to identify patterns associated with depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.",39892758,M Alexandra Kredlow,Tufts University,Department of Psychology,"Combining data-driven natural language processing techniques with traditional methods using predefined word lists may offer greater insights into the connections between language patterns and depression and anxiety symptoms, particularly within specific stressful contexts. Between 2020 and 2021, 1106 participants wrote narrative responses describing their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic and completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS). We investigated language patterns associated with DASS symptoms using established categories from Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) and sentiment analysis, as well as exploratory natural language processing techniques. Finally, we constructed machine learning regression models in order to assess how much of the variance in DASS symptoms is related to language use. We found significant positive bivariate correlations between total DASS symptoms and hypothesized LIWC categories: first-person singular pronouns, absolute language, and negative emotion words. These results remained largely similar when using negative sentiment scores and when statistically controlling for gender, age, and education. Exploratory n-gram analyses also revealed new individual words and phrases correlated with total DASS symptoms. Lastly, our regression models demonstrated a significant association between language use and total DASS symptoms (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.36-0.62). The current study is one of the first to examine associations between language use and DASS symptoms during the pandemic using both traditional and data-driven techniques. These results replicate and extend prior findings regarding negative emotion and absolute language and identify unique correlates of DASS symptoms during pandemic-related stress, contributing to the literature on language and mental health more broadly."
A novel machine learning based framework for developing composite digital biomarkers of disease progression.,39867644,Richard Baumgartner,Biostatistics and Research Decision Sciences,N/A,"Current methods of measuring disease progression of neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), largely rely on composite clinical rating scales, which are prone to subjective biases and lack the sensitivity to detect progression signals in a timely manner. Digital health technology (DHT)-derived measures offer potential solutions to provide objective, precise, and sensitive measures that address these limitations. However, the complexity of DHT datasets and the potential to derive numerous digital features that were not previously possible to measure pose challenges, including in selection of the most important digital features and construction of composite digital biomarkers. We present a comprehensive machine learning based framework to construct composite digital biomarkers for progression tracking. This framework consists of a marginal (univariate) digital feature screening, a univariate association test, digital feature selection, and subsequent construction of composite (multivariate) digital disease progression biomarkers using Penalized Generalized Estimating Equations (PGEE). As an illustrative example, we applied this framework to data collected from a PD longitudinal observational study. The data consisted of Opal™ sensor-based movement measurements and MDS-UPDRS Part III scores collected at 3-month intervals for 2 years in 30 PD and 10 healthy control participants. In our illustrative example, 77 out of 235 digital features from the study passed univariate feature screening, with 11 features selected by PGEE to include in construction of the composite digital measure. Compared to MDS-UPDRS Part III, the composite digital measure exhibited a smoother and more significant increasing trend over time in PD groups with less variability, indicating improved ability for tracking disease progression. This composite digital measure also demonstrated the ability to classify between <i>de novo</i> PD and healthy control groups. Measures from DHTs show promise in tracking neurodegenerative disease progression with increased sensitivity and reduced variability as compared to traditional clinical scores. Herein, we present a novel framework and methodology to construct composite digital measure of disease progression from high-dimensional DHT datasets, which may have utility in accelerating the development and application of composite digital biomarkers in drug development."
Development and application of a machine learning-based antenatal depression prediction model.,39848469,Qiong Luo,Women's Hospital,Department of Obstetrics,"Antenatal depression (AND), occurring during pregnancy, is associated with severe outcomes. However, there is a lack of objective and universally applicable prediction methods for AND in clinical practice. We leveraged sociodemographic and pregnancy-related data to develop and validate a machine learning-based AND prediction model. Data from 20,950 pregnant women form 3 hospitals were used and divided into training and test sets. AND was defined as an EPDS score of 10 or above. Using machine learning, we selected 34 characteristic variables and divided them into three categories based on clinical practice: Base Variables, General Variables, and Obstetric Variables. Based on this classification, we constructed four different AND random forest prediction models: the Base Model, the Base+General Model, the Base+Obstetric Model, and the Full Model. The AUC range in the test set was 0.687-0.710. The Base+General Model achieved the best performance with an AUC of 0.710 (95 % CI: 0.693-0.710) in predicting AND risk during the late pregnancy period. The AUC of the Base Model was only 0.022 lower than that of the top-performing model, indicating its solid foundation for early AND screening. We have only analyzed the dataset from two eastern cities, and have not yet validated our models in an external dataset. Machine learning-based prediction models offer the capability to anticipate the risk of AND across different pregnancy stages. This enables the earlier and more accurate identification of pregnant women who may be at risk, facilitating timely interventions for improving outcomes for both mothers and their offspring."
White matter predictors of PTSD: Testing different machine learning models in a sample of Black American women.,37922600,Negar Fani,Emory University School of Medicine,Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences,"Machine learning neuroimaging studies of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) show promise for identifying neurobiological signatures of PTSD. However, studies to date, have largely evaluated a single machine learning approach, and few studies have examined white matter microstructure as a predictor of PTSD. Further, individuals from minoritized racial groups, specifically, Black individuals, who experience disproportionate trauma frequency, and have relatively higher rates of PTSD, have been underrepresented in these studies. We used four different machine learning models to test white matter microstructure classifiers of PTSD in a sample of trauma-exposed Black American women with and without PTSD. Participants included 45 Black women with PTSD and 89 trauma-exposed controls recruited from an ongoing trauma study. Current PTSD presence was estimated using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. Average fractional anisotropy of 53 white matter tracts served as input features. Additional exploratory analysis incorporated estimates of interpersonal and structural racism exposure. Classification models included linear support vector machine, radial basis function support vector machine, multilayer perceptron, and random forest. Performance varied notably between models. With white matter features along, linear support vector machine demonstrated the best model fit and reached an average AUC = 0.643. Inclusion of estimates of exposure to racism increased linear support vector machine performance (AUC = 0.808). White matter microstructure had limited ability to predict PTSD presence in this sample. These results may indicate that the relationship between white matter microstructure and PTSD may be nuanced across race and gender spectrums."
Early Attrition Prediction for Web-Based Interpretation Bias Modification to Reduce Anxious Thinking: A Machine Learning Study.,39705068,Laura E Barnes,University of Virginia,Department of Systems and Information Engineering,"Digital mental health is a promising paradigm for individualized, patient-driven health care. For example, cognitive bias modification programs that target interpretation biases (cognitive bias modification for interpretation [CBM-I]) can provide practice thinking about ambiguous situations in less threatening ways on the web without requiring a therapist. However, digital mental health interventions, including CBM-I, are often plagued with lack of sustained engagement and high attrition rates. New attrition detection and mitigation strategies are needed to improve these interventions. This paper aims to identify participants at a high risk of dropout during the early stages of 3 web-based trials of multisession CBM-I and to investigate which self-reported and passively detected feature sets computed from the participants interacting with the intervention and assessments were most informative in making this prediction. The participants analyzed in this paper were community adults with traits such as anxiety or negative thinking about the future (Study 1: n=252, Study 2: n=326, Study 3: n=699) who had been assigned to CBM-I conditions in 3 efficacy-effectiveness trials on our team's public research website. To identify participants at a high risk of dropout, we created 4 unique feature sets: self-reported baseline user characteristics (eg, demographics), self-reported user context and reactions to the program (eg, state affect), self-reported user clinical functioning (eg, mental health symptoms), and passively detected user behavior on the website (eg, time spent on a web page of CBM-I training exercises, time of day during which the exercises were completed, latency of completing the assessments, and type of device used). Then, we investigated the feature sets as potential predictors of which participants were at high risk of not starting the second training session of a given program using well-known machine learning algorithms. The extreme gradient boosting algorithm performed the best and identified participants at high risk with macro-F<sub>1</sub>-scores of .832 (Study 1 with 146 features), .770 (Study 2 with 87 features), and .917 (Study 3 with 127 features). Features involving passive detection of user behavior contributed the most to the prediction relative to other features. The mean Gini importance scores for the passive features were as follows: .033 (95% CI .019-.047) in Study 1; .029 (95% CI .023-.035) in Study 2; and .045 (95% CI .039-.051) in Study 3. However, using all features extracted from a given study led to the best predictive performance. These results suggest that using passive indicators of user behavior, alongside self-reported measures, can improve the accuracy of prediction of participants at a high risk of dropout early during multisession CBM-I programs. Furthermore, our analyses highlight the challenge of generalizability in digital health intervention studies and the need for more personalized attrition prevention strategies."
ItpCtrl-AI: End-to-end interpretable and controllable artificial intelligence by modeling radiologists' intentions.,39689443,Ngan Le,University of Arkansas,AICV Lab,"Using Deep Learning in computer-aided diagnosis systems has been of great interest due to its impressive performance in the general domain and medical domain. However, a notable challenge is the lack of explainability of many advanced models, which poses risks in critical applications such as diagnosing findings in CXR. To address this problem, we propose ItpCtrl-AI, a novel end-to-end interpretable and controllable framework that mirrors the decision-making process of the radiologist. By emulating the eye gaze patterns of radiologists, our framework initially determines the focal areas and assesses the significance of each pixel within those regions. As a result, the model generates an attention heatmap representing radiologists' attention, which is then used to extract attended visual information to diagnose the findings. By allowing the directional input, our framework is controllable by the user. Furthermore, by displaying the eye gaze heatmap which guides the diagnostic conclusion, the underlying rationale behind the model's decision is revealed, thereby making it interpretable. In addition to developing an interpretable and controllable framework, our work includes the creation of a dataset, named Diagnosed-Gaze++, which aligns medical findings with eye gaze data. Our extensive experimentation validates the effectiveness of our approach in generating accurate attention heatmaps and diagnoses. The experimental results show that our model not only accurately identifies medical findings but also precisely produces the eye gaze attention of radiologists. The dataset, models, and source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance."
Associations between NIH Toolbox Emotion Battery measures and previous suicide attempt in bipolar I disorder.,39672472,Vincent A Magnotta,The University of Iowa,Department of Radiology,"Suicide attempts are more prevalent in people with bipolar I disorder (BD-I) than in the general population. Most prior studies of suicide in BD-I have focused on separate emotion-related assays or clinician-administered scales, whereas a single, brief, and multidimensional battery of self-report measures has not yet been explored. Here, we utilized the NIH Toolbox Emotion Battery (NIHTB-EB) to assess various emotional measures, determine which were cross-sectionally associated with prior suicide attempt in BD-I, evaluate whether the NIHTB-EB could be used to identify past suicide attempt in BD-I with machine learning, and compare model performance versus using clinical mood scales. The study included 39 participants with BD-I and history of suicide attempt, 48 with BD-I without history of suicide attempt, and 58 controls. We found that 9 of the 17 measures were associated with past suicide attempt in BD-I. The initial random forest model indicated that the most important distinguishing variables were perceived stress, emotional support, anger-hostility, anger-physical aggression, perceived rejection, loneliness, and self-efficacy. Overall, the models utilizing NIHTB-EB measures performed better (69.0 % to 70.1 % accuracy) than the model containing clinical mood scale information without the NIHTB-EB measures (57.5 % accuracy). These findings suggest the NIHTB-EB could be a useful and easy-to-deploy tool in understanding the role of emotion-related measures in suicide in BD-I. Furthermore, these results highlight specific emotional subdomains that could be promising targets for longitudinal studies or interventions aimed at reducing suicide in BD-I."
Using large language models to detect outcomes in qualitative studies of adolescent depression.,39661754,Juan Antonio Lossio-Ventura,National Institute of Mental Health,N/A,"We aim to use large language models (LLMs) to detect mentions of nuanced psychotherapeutic outcomes and impacts than previously considered in transcripts of interviews with adolescent depression. Our clinical authors previously created a novel coding framework containing fine-grained therapy outcomes beyond the binary classification (eg, depression vs control) based on qualitative analysis embedded within a clinical study of depression. Moreover, we seek to demonstrate that embeddings from LLMs are informative enough to accurately label these experiences. Data were drawn from interviews, where text segments were annotated with different outcome labels. Five different open-source LLMs were evaluated to classify outcomes from the coding framework. Classification experiments were carried out in the original interview transcripts. Furthermore, we repeated those experiments for versions of the data produced by breaking those segments into conversation turns, or keeping non-interviewer utterances (monologues). We used classification models to predict 31 outcomes and 8 derived labels, for 3 different text segmentations. Area under the ROC curve scores ranged between 0.6 and 0.9 for the original segmentation and 0.7 and 1.0 for the monologues and turns. LLM-based classification models could identify outcomes important to adolescents, such as friendships or academic and vocational functioning, in text transcripts of patient interviews. By using clinical data, we also aim to better generalize to clinical settings compared to studies based on public social media data. Our results demonstrate that fine-grained therapy outcome coding in psychotherapeutic text is feasible, and can be used to support the quantification of important outcomes for downstream uses."
Brain morphometric features predict medication response in youth with bipolar disorder: a prospective randomized clinical trial.,35392995,Melissa P DelBello,University of Cincinnati College of Medicine,Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience,"Identification of treatment-specific predictors of drug therapies for bipolar disorder (BD) is important because only about half of individuals respond to any specific medication. However, medication response in pediatric BD is variable and not well predicted by clinical characteristics. A total of 121 youth with early course BD (acute manic/mixed episode) were prospectively recruited and randomized to 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with quetiapine (<i>n</i> = 71) or lithium (<i>n</i> = 50). Participants completed structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline before treatment and 1 week after treatment initiation, and brain morphometric features were extracted for each individual based on MRI scans. Positive antimanic treatment response at week 6 was defined as an over 50% reduction of Young Mania Rating Scale scores from baseline. Two-stage deep learning prediction model was established to distinguish responders and non-responders based on different feature sets. Pre-treatment morphometry and morphometric changes occurring during the first week can both independently predict treatment outcome of quetiapine and lithium with balanced accuracy over 75% (all <i>p</i> < 0.05). Combining brain morphometry at baseline and week 1 allows prediction with the highest balanced accuracy (quetiapine: 83.2% and lithium: 83.5%). Predictions in the quetiapine and lithium group were found to be driven by different morphometric patterns. These findings demonstrate that pre-treatment morphometric measures and acute brain morphometric changes can serve as medication response predictors in pediatric BD. Brain morphometric features may provide promising biomarkers for developing biologically-informed treatment outcome prediction and patient stratification tools for BD treatment development."
Using machine learning modeling to identify childhood abuse victims on the basis of personality inventory responses.,39366273,Philip D Harvey,University of Miami Miller School of Medicine,University of Miami Miller School of Medicine,"Trauma is very common and associated with significant co-morbidity world-wide, particularly PTSD and frequently other mental health disorders. However, it can be challenging to identify victims of abuse as self-reports can be difficult to elicit due to emotional distress. Better confirmation of a history of significant mistreatment can assist significantly in treatment planning. We evaluate an alternate approach based on machine-learning techniques applied to personality inventory data (Minnesota Personality Inventory, Adolescent Version; MMPI-A) obtained concurrently to examine convergence with reports of past trauma exposure. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) was administered to 733 child and adolescent inpatients. Statistical and information-theory measures showed that each type of abuse - sexual, physical, and emotional - had a unique ""fingerprint"" of MMPI-A profiles. In contrast to our previous findings in terms of specific correlations with IQ, individuals positive for Sexual abuse had the fewest MMPI-A elevations, followed by Physical abuse, while those reporting Emotional abuse had the greatest number of elevations. We developed an initial classifier Machine Learning (ML) model for predicting a history of abuse that demonstrates equivalent sensitivity compared to other widely used screening measures. In addition, we show via PCA and cluster analysis that the different levels of severity of emotional abuse present with unique mixtures of personality trait characteristics. Thus, this type of ML mediated analysis could permit at-scale detection of those at potential high risk of a history of abuse by use of real-time information, using a variety of nontransparent data sources."
Characterizing Veteran suicide decedents that were not classified as high-suicide-risk.,39282853,Brian Shiner,White River Junction VA Medical Center,White River Junction VA Medical Center,"Although the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has made important suicide prevention advances, efforts primarily target high-risk patients with documented suicide risk, such as suicidal ideation, prior suicide attempts, and recent psychiatric hospitalization. Approximately 90% of VA patients that go on to die by suicide do not meet these high-risk criteria and therefore do not receive targeted suicide prevention services. In this study, we used national VA data to focus on patients that were not classified as high-risk, but died by suicide. Our sample included all VA patients who died by suicide in 2017 or 2018. We determined whether patients were classified as high-risk using the VA's machine learning risk prediction algorithm. After excluding these patients, we used principal component analysis to identify moderate-risk and low-risk patients and investigated demographics, service-usage, diagnoses, and social determinants of health differences across high-, moderate-, and low-risk subgroups. High-risk (<i>n</i> = 452) patients tended to be younger, White, unmarried, homeless, and have more mental health diagnoses compared to moderate- (<i>n</i> = 2149) and low-risk (<i>n</i> = 2209) patients. Moderate- and low-risk patients tended to be older, married, Black, and Native American or Pacific Islander, and have more physical health diagnoses compared to high-risk patients. Low-risk patients had more missing data than higher-risk patients. Study expands epidemiological understanding about non-high-risk suicide decedents, historically understudied and underserved populations. Findings raise concerns about reliance on machine learning risk prediction models that may be biased by relative underrepresentation of racial/ethnic minorities within health system."
"The Normalization of Vaping on TikTok Using Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Qualitative Thematic Analysis: Mixed Methods Study.",39259963,Anna V Wilkinson,University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston School of Public Health,University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston School of Public Health,"Social media posts that portray vaping in positive social contexts shape people's perceptions and serve to normalize vaping. Despite restrictions on depicting or promoting controlled substances, vape-related content is easily accessible on TikTok. There is a need to understand strategies used in promoting vaping on TikTok, especially among susceptible youth audiences. This study seeks to comprehensively describe direct (ie, explicit promotional efforts) and indirect (ie, subtler strategies) themes promoting vaping on TikTok using a mixture of computational and qualitative thematic analyses of social media posts. In addition, we aim to describe how these themes might play a role in normalizing vaping behavior on TikTok for youth audiences, thereby informing public health communication and regulatory policies regarding vaping endorsements on TikTok. We collected 14,002 unique TikTok posts using 50 vape-related hashtags (eg, #vapetok and #boxmod). Using the k-means unsupervised machine learning algorithm, we identified clusters and then categorized posts qualitatively based on themes. Next, we organized all videos from the posts thematically and extracted the visual features of each theme using 3 machine learning-based model architectures: residual network (ResNet) with 50 layers (ResNet50), Visual Geometry Group model with 16 layers, and vision transformer. We chose the best-performing model, ResNet50, to thoroughly analyze the image clustering output. To assess clustering accuracy, we examined 4.01% (441/10,990) of the samples from each video cluster. Finally, we randomly selected 50 videos (5% of the total videos) from each theme, which were qualitatively coded and compared with the machine-derived classification for validation. We successfully identified 5 major themes from the TikTok posts. Vape product marketing (1160/10,990, 8.28%) reflected direct marketing, while the other 4 themes reflected indirect marketing: TikTok influencer (3775/14,002, 26.96%), general vape (2741/14,002, 19.58%), vape brands (2042/14,002, 14.58%), and vaping cessation (1272/14,002, 9.08%). The ResNet50 model successfully classified clusters based on image features, achieving an average F<sub>1</sub>-score of 0.97, the highest among the 3 models. Qualitative content analyses indicated that vaping was depicted as a normal, routine part of daily life, with TikTok influencers subtly incorporating vaping into popular culture (eg, gaming, skateboarding, and tattooing) and social practices (eg, shopping sprees, driving, and grocery shopping). The results from both computational and qualitative analyses of text and visual data reveal that vaping is normalized on TikTok. Our identified themes underscore how everyday conversations, promotional content, and the influence of popular figures collectively contribute to depicting vaping as a normal and accepted aspect of daily life on TikTok. Our study provides valuable insights for regulatory policies and public health initiatives aimed at tackling the normalization of vaping on social media platforms."
From Tweets to Streets: Observational Study on the Association Between Twitter Sentiment and Anti-Asian Hate Crimes in New York City from 2019 to 2022.,39250221,Thu T Nguyen,University of Maryland,Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics,"Anti-Asian hate crimes escalated during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, limited research has explored the association between social media sentiment and hate crimes toward Asian communities. This study aims to investigate the relationship between Twitter (rebranded as X) sentiment data and the occurrence of anti-Asian hate crimes in New York City from 2019 to 2022, a period encompassing both before and during COVID-19 pandemic conditions. We used a hate crime dataset from the New York City Police Department. This dataset included detailed information on the occurrence of anti-Asian hate crimes at the police precinct level from 2019 to 2022. We used Twitter's application programming interface for Academic Research to collect a random 1% sample of publicly available Twitter data in New York State, including New York City, that included 1 or more of the selected Asian-related keywords and applied support vector machine to classify sentiment. We measured sentiment toward the Asian community using the rates of negative and positive sentiment expressed in tweets at the monthly level (N=48). We used negative binomial models to explore the associations between sentiment levels and the number of anti-Asian hate crimes in the same month. We further adjusted our models for confounders such as the unemployment rate and the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. As sensitivity analyses, we used distributed lag models to capture 1- to 2-month lag times. A point increase of 1% in negative sentiment rate toward the Asian community in the same month was associated with a 24% increase (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.24; 95% CI 1.07-1.44; P=.005) in the number of anti-Asian hate crimes. The association was slightly attenuated after adjusting for unemployment and COVID-19 emergence (ie, after March 2020; P=.008). The positive sentiment toward Asian tweets with a 0-month lag was associated with a 12% decrease (IRR 0.88; 95% CI 0.79-0.97; P=.002) in expected anti-Asian hate crimes in the same month, but the relationship was no longer significant after adjusting for the unemployment rate and the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic (P=.11). A higher negative sentiment level was associated with more hate crimes specifically targeting the Asian community in the same month. The findings highlight the importance of monitoring public sentiment to predict and potentially mitigate hate crimes against Asian individuals."
What's in a trauma? Using machine learning to unpack what makes an event traumatic.,34378537,Payton J Jones,Harvard University,Department of Psychology,"What differentiates a trauma from an event that is merely upsetting? Wildly different definitions of trauma have been used in both formal (psychiatric) and informal (cultural, colloquial) settings. Yet there is a dearth of empirical work examining the features of events that individuals use to define an event as a 'trauma.' First, a group of qualitative coders classified features (e.g., actual physical injury, loss of possessions) of 600 event descriptions (e.g., ""was verbally harassed by a boss,"" ""watched a video of an adult being shot and killed""). Next, across two studies, machine learning was used to predict whether individuals rated event descriptions as 'trauma' or 'traumatic' in over 100,000 judgment tasks. In Study 1, examining continuous ratings from 'not at all traumatic' to 'extremely traumatic,' a cross-validated LASSO regression with polynomial features provided the best out-of-sample predictions (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.76), outperforming ridge regression, support vector regression, and linear regression. In Study 2, using binary judgments, a random forest model accurately predicted out-of-sample individual responses (AUC = 0.96), outperforming a neural network and an AdaBoost ensemble classifier. The most important event features across the two studies were actual death, threat of death, and the presence of a human perpetrator. The most important human features in predicting judgments were political orientation and gender."
The relationship between text message sentiment and self-reported depression.,34963643,Lyle H Ungar,University of Pennsylvania,Department of Computer and Information Science,"Personal sensing has shown promise for detecting behavioral correlates of depression, but there is little work examining personal sensing of cognitive and affective states. Digital language, particularly through personal text messages, is one source that can measure these markers. We correlated privacy-preserving sentiment analysis of text messages with self-reported depression symptom severity. We enrolled 219 U.S. adults in a 16 week longitudinal observational study. Participants installed a personal sensing app on their phones, which administered self-report PHQ-8 assessments of their depression severity, collected phone sensor data, and computed anonymized language sentiment scores from their text messages. We also trained machine learning models for predicting end-of-study self-reported depression status using on blocks of phone sensor and text features. In correlation analyses, we find that degrees of depression, emotional, and personal pronoun language categories correlate most strongly with self-reported depression, validating prior literature. Our classification models which predict binary depression status achieve a leave-one-out AUC of 0.72 when only considering text features and 0.76 when combining text with other networked smartphone sensors. Participants were recruited from a panel that over-represented women, caucasians, and individuals with self-reported depression at baseline. As language use differs across demographic factors, generalizability beyond this population may be limited. The study period also coincided with the initial COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, which may have affected smartphone sensor data quality. Effective depression prediction through text message sentiment, especially when combined with other personal sensors, could enable comprehensive mental health monitoring and intervention."
The signature-testing approach to mapping biological and artificial intelligences.,35773138,Colin Allen,University of Pittsburgh,Department of History and Philosophy of Science,"Making inferences from behaviour to cognition is problematic due to a many-to-one mapping problem, in which any one behaviour can be generated by multiple possible cognitive processes. Attempts to cross this inferential gap when comparing human intelligence to that of animals or machines can generate great debate. Here, we discuss the challenges of making comparisons using 'success-testing' approaches and call attention to an alternate experimental framework, the 'signature-testing' approach. Signature testing places the search for information-processing errors, biases, and other patterns centre stage, rather than focussing predominantly on problem-solving success. We highlight current research on both biological and artificial intelligence that fits within this framework and is creating proactive research programs that make strong inferences about the similarities and differences between the content of human, animal, and machine minds."
Classification of Patients' Judgments of Their Physicians in Web-Based Written Reviews Using Natural Language Processing: Algorithm Development and Validation.,39088259,Peter A Ubel,Duke University,Sanford School of Public Policy,"Patients increasingly rely on web-based physician reviews to choose a physician and share their experiences. However, the unstructured text of these written reviews presents a challenge for researchers seeking to make inferences about patients' judgments. Methods previously used to identify patient judgments within reviews, such as hand-coding and dictionary-based approaches, have posed limitations to sample size and classification accuracy. Advanced natural language processing methods can help overcome these limitations and promote further analysis of physician reviews on these popular platforms. This study aims to train, test, and validate an advanced natural language processing algorithm for classifying the presence and valence of 2 dimensions of patient judgments in web-based physician reviews: interpersonal manner and technical competence. We sampled 345,053 reviews for 167,150 physicians across the United States from Healthgrades.com, a commercial web-based physician rating and review website. We hand-coded 2000 written reviews and used those reviews to train and test a transformer classification algorithm called the Robustly Optimized BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa). The 2 fine-tuned models coded the reviews for the presence and positive or negative valence of patients' interpersonal manner or technical competence judgments of their physicians. We evaluated the performance of the 2 models against 200 hand-coded reviews and validated the models using the full sample of 345,053 RoBERTa-coded reviews. The interpersonal manner model was 90% accurate with precision of 0.89, recall of 0.90, and weighted F<sub>1</sub>-score of 0.89. The technical competence model was 90% accurate with precision of 0.91, recall of 0.90, and weighted F<sub>1</sub>-score of 0.90. Positive-valence judgments were associated with higher review star ratings whereas negative-valence judgments were associated with lower star ratings. Analysis of the data by review rating and physician gender corresponded with findings in prior literature. Our 2 classification models coded interpersonal manner and technical competence judgments with high precision, recall, and accuracy. These models were validated using review star ratings and results from previous research. RoBERTa can accurately classify unstructured, web-based review text at scale. Future work could explore the use of this algorithm with other textual data, such as social media posts and electronic health records."
Neural landscape is associated with functional outcomes in irradiated patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.,39083586,Moran Amit,University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center,Department of Head and Neck Surgery,"The incidence of human papilloma virus-mediated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has increased over the past 40 years, particularly among young individuals with a favorable prognosis; however, current therapy often leads to unfortunate side effects, such as dysphagia. Despite the emphasis on dysphagia in previous studies, there is an important research gap in understanding the correlation between neuronal changes and patient-reported and functional outcomes in patients with OPSCC. To address this issue, we examined pathologic tissue samples from patients with OPSCC using multiplex immunofluorescence staining and machine learning to correlate tumor-associated neuronal changes with prospectively collected patient-reported and functional outcomes. We found that tumor enrichment of adrenergic (TH<sup>+</sup>) and CGRP<sup>+</sup> sensory-afferent nerves correlated with poorer swallowing outcomes. Functional electromyography recordings showed correlations between growing (GAP43<sup>+</sup>) and immature cholinergic (ChAT<sup>+</sup>DCX<sup>+</sup>) nerves and denervation patterns in survivors of OPSCC. A murine model of radiation-induced dysphagia further confirmed that immature cholinergic and CGRP<sup>+</sup> nerves were correlated with impaired swallowing. Preclinical interventional studies also supported the independent contributions of CGRP<sup>+</sup> and cholinergic (ChAT<sup>+</sup>) nerves to dysphagia in treated mouse models of OPSCC. Our results suggest that CGRP<sup>+</sup> and ChAT<sup>+</sup> neuronal signaling play distinct roles in tumor- and radiation-induced dysphagia in OPSCC and offer a comprehensive dataset on the neural landscape of OPSCC. These insights may guide early interventions for swallow preservation and the repurposing of neurology-related drugs, such as CGRP blockers, in clinical oncology and survivorship."
From promise to practice: towards the realisation of AI-informed mental health care.,36229346,Munmun De Choudhury,Georgia Institute of Technology,School of Interactive Computing,"In this Series paper, we explore the promises and challenges of artificial intelligence (AI)-based precision medicine tools in mental health care from clinical, ethical, and regulatory perspectives. The real-world implementation of these tools is increasingly considered the prime solution for key issues in mental health, such as delayed, inaccurate, and inefficient care delivery. Similarly, machine-learning-based empirical strategies are becoming commonplace in psychiatric research because of their potential to adequately deconstruct the biopsychosocial complexity of mental health disorders, and hence to improve nosology of prognostic and preventive paradigms. However, the implementation steps needed to translate these promises into practice are currently hampered by multiple interacting challenges. These obstructions range from the current technology-distant state of clinical practice, over the lack of valid real-world databases required to feed data-intensive AI algorithms, to model development and validation considerations being disconnected from the core principles of clinical utility and ethical acceptability. In this Series paper, we provide recommendations on how these challenges could be addressed from an interdisciplinary perspective to pave the way towards a framework for mental health care, leveraging the combined strengths of human intelligence and AI."
Considering the Role of Human Empathy in AI-Driven Therapy.,38861302,Anat Perry,Hebrew University of Jerusalem,Psychology Department,"Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) language models have elevated the vision of using conversational AI support for mental health, with a growing body of literature indicating varying degrees of efficacy. In this paper, we ask when, in therapy, it will be easier to replace humans and, conversely, in what instances, human connection will still be more valued. We suggest that empathy lies at the heart of the answer to this question. First, we define different aspects of empathy and outline the potential empathic capabilities of humans versus AI. Next, we consider what determines when these aspects are needed most in therapy, both from the perspective of therapeutic methodology and from the perspective of patient objectives. Ultimately, our goal is to prompt further investigation and dialogue, urging both practitioners and scholars engaged in AI-mediated therapy to keep these questions and considerations in mind when investigating AI implementation in mental health."
Temporal prediction of suicidal ideation in an ecological momentary assessment study with recurrent neural networks.,38795778,Hanga Galfalvy,New York State Psychiatric Institute,Mental Health Data Science Division,"Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) holds promise for providing insights into daily life experiences when studying mental health phenomena. However, commonly used mixed-effects linear statistical models do not fully utilize the richness of the ultidimensional time-varying data that EMA yields. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) provide an alternative data analytic method to leverage more information and potentially improve prediction, particularly for non-normally distributed outcomes. As part of a broader research study of suicidal thoughts and behavior in people with borderline personality disorder (BPD), eighty-four participants engaged in EMA data collection over one week, answering questions multiple times each day about suicidal ideation (SI), stressful events, coping strategy use, and affect. RNNs and mixed-effects linear regression models (MEMs) were trained and used to predict SI. Root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute percent error (MAPE), and a pseudo-R<sup>2</sup> accuracy metric were used to compare SI prediction accuracy between the two modeling methods. RNNs had superior accuracy metrics (full model: RMSE = 3.41, MAPE = 42 %, pseudo-R<sup>2</sup> = 26 %) compared with MEMs (full model: RMSE = 3.84, MAPE = 56 %, pseudo-R<sup>2</sup> = 16 %). Importantly, RNNs showed significantly more accurate prediction at higher values of SI. Additionally, RNNs predicted, with significantly higher accuracy, the SI scores of participants with depression diagnoses and of participants with higher depression scores at baseline. In this EMA study with a moderately sized sample, RNNs were better able to learn and predict daily SI compared with mixed-effects models. RNNs should be considered as an option for EMA analysis."
Beyond learnability: understanding human visual development with DNNs.,38762430,Lei Yuan,University of Colorado Boulder,Department of Psychology and Neuroscience,"Recently, Orhan and Lake demonstrated the computational plausibility that children can acquire sophisticated visual representations from natural input data without inherent biases, challenging the need for innate constraints in human learning. The findings may also reveal crucial properties of early visual learning and inform theories of human visual development."
Emerging Trends of Self-Harm Using Sodium Nitrite in an Online Suicide Community: Observational Study Using Natural Language Processing Analysis.,38722220,Abeed Sarker,Emory University,Department of Biomedical Informatics,"There is growing concern around the use of sodium nitrite (SN) as an emerging means of suicide, particularly among younger people. Given the limited information on the topic from traditional public health surveillance sources, we studied posts made to an online suicide discussion forum, ""Sanctioned Suicide,"" which is a primary source of information on the use and procurement of SN. This study aims to determine the trends in SN purchase and use, as obtained via data mining from subscriber posts on the forum. We also aim to determine the substances and topics commonly co-occurring with SN, as well as the geographical distribution of users and sources of SN. We collected all publicly available from the site's inception in March 2018 to October 2022. Using data-driven methods, including natural language processing and machine learning, we analyzed the trends in SN mentions over time, including the locations of SN consumers and the sources from which SN is procured. We developed a transformer-based source and location classifier to determine the geographical distribution of the sources of SN. Posts pertaining to SN show a rise in popularity, and there were statistically significant correlations between real-life use of SN and suicidal intent when compared to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (⍴=0.727; P<.001) and the National Poison Data System (⍴=0.866; P=.001). We observed frequent co-mentions of antiemetics, benzodiazepines, and acid regulators with SN. Our proposed machine learning-based source and location classifier can detect potential sources of SN with an accuracy of 72.92% and showed consumption in the United States and elsewhere. Vital information about SN and other emerging mechanisms of suicide can be obtained from online forums."
Prediction of the trajectories of depressive symptoms among children in the adolescent brain cognitive development (ABCD) study using machine learning approach.,35545159,Xiaobo Zhou,University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston,School of Biomedical Informatics,"Depression often first emerges during adolescence and evidence shows that the long-term patterns of depressive symptoms over time are heterogeneous. It is meaningful to predict the trajectory of depressive symptoms in adolescents to find early intervention targets. Based on the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study, we included 4962 participants aged 9-10 who were followed-up for 2 years. Trajectories of depressive symptoms were identified by Latent Class Growth Analyses (LCGA). Four types of machine learning models were built to predict the identified trajectories and to obtain variables with predictive value based on the best performance model. Of all participants, 536 (10.80%) were classified as increasing, 269 (5.42%) as persistently high, 433 (8.73%) as decreasing, and 3724 (75.05%) as persistently low by LCGA. Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model got the highest discriminant performance. Sleep quality, parental emotional state and family financial adversities were the most important predictors and three resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging functional connectivity data were also helpful to distinguish trajectories. We only have depressive symptom scores at three time points. Some valuable predictors are not specific to depression. External validation is an important next step. These predictors should not be interpreted as etiology and some variables were reported by parents/caregivers. Using GBM combined with baseline characteristics, the trajectories of depressive symptoms with two years among adolescents aged 9-10 years can be well predicted, which might further facilitate the identification of adolescents at high risk of depressive symptoms and development of effective early interventions."
Transparent deep learning to identify autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in EHR using clinical notes.,38626184,Sydney A Rice,The University of Arizona,Department of Pediatrics,"Machine learning (ML) is increasingly employed to diagnose medical conditions, with algorithms trained to assign a single label using a black-box approach. We created an ML approach using deep learning that generates outcomes that are transparent and in line with clinical, diagnostic rules. We demonstrate our approach for autism spectrum disorders (ASD), a neurodevelopmental condition with increasing prevalence. We use unstructured data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance records labeled by a CDC-trained clinician with ASD A1-3 and B1-4 criterion labels per sentence and with ASD cases labels per record using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM5) rules. One rule-based and three deep ML algorithms and six ensembles were compared and evaluated using a test set with 6773 sentences (N = 35 cases) set aside in advance. Criterion and case labeling were evaluated for each ML algorithm and ensemble. Case labeling outcomes were compared also with seven traditional tests. Performance for criterion labeling was highest for the hybrid BiLSTM ML model. The best case labeling was achieved by an ensemble of two BiLSTM ML models using a majority vote. It achieved 100% precision (or PPV), 83% recall (or sensitivity), 100% specificity, 91% accuracy, and 0.91 F-measure. A comparison with existing diagnostic tests shows that our best ensemble was more accurate overall. Transparent ML is achievable even with small datasets. By focusing on intermediate steps, deep ML can provide transparent decisions. By leveraging data redundancies, ML errors at the intermediate level have a low impact on final outcomes."
Machine Learning and Health Science Research: Tutorial.,38289657,Arti V Virkud,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,Kidney Center,"Machine learning (ML) has seen impressive growth in health science research due to its capacity for handling complex data to perform a range of tasks, including unsupervised learning, supervised learning, and reinforcement learning. To aid health science researchers in understanding the strengths and limitations of ML and to facilitate its integration into their studies, we present here a guideline for integrating ML into an analysis through a structured framework, covering steps from framing a research question to study design and analysis techniques for specialized data types."
BGRL: Basal Ganglia inspired Reinforcement Learning based framework for deep brain stimulators.,38184360,Heena Rathore,Department of Computer Science at Texas State University,Department of Computer Science at Texas State University,"Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is an implantable medical device used for electrical stimulation to treat neurological disorders. Traditional DBS devices provide fixed frequency pulses, but personalized adjustment of stimulation parameters is crucial for optimal treatment. This paper introduces a Basal Ganglia inspired Reinforcement Learning (BGRL) approach, incorporating a closed-loop feedback mechanism to suppress neural synchrony during neurological fluctuations. The BGRL approach leverages the resemblance between the Basal Ganglia region of brain by incorporating the actor-critic architecture of reinforcement learning (RL). Simulation results demonstrate that BGRL significantly reduces synchronous electrical pulses compared to other standard RL algorithms. BGRL algorithm outperforms existing RL methods in terms of suppression capability and energy consumption, validated through comparisons using ensemble oscillators. Results shown in the paper demonstrate BGRL suppressed the synchronous electrical pulses across three signaling regimes namely regular, chaotic and bursting by 40%, 146% and 40% respectively as compared to soft actor-critic model. BGRL shows promise in effectively suppressing neural synchrony in DBS therapy, providing an efficient alternative to open-loop methodologies."
Auditory chaos classification in real-world environments.,38178925,Kaya de Barbaro,The University of Texas at Austin,Department of Psychology,"Household chaos is an established risk factor for child development. However, current methods for measuring household chaos rely on parent surveys, meaning existing research efforts cannot disentangle potentially dynamic bidirectional relations between high chaos environments and child behavior problems. We train and make publicly available a classifier to provide objective, high-resolution predictions of household chaos from real-world child-worn audio recordings. To do so, we collect and annotate a novel dataset of ground-truth auditory chaos labels compiled from over 411 h of daylong recordings collected via audio recorders worn by <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mi>N</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>22</mn></math> infants in their homes. We leverage an existing sound event classifier to identify candidate high chaos segments, increasing annotation efficiency 8.32<math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mo>×</mo></math> relative to random sampling. Our best-performing model successfully classifies four levels of real-world household auditory chaos with a macro F1 score of 0.701 (Precision: 0.705, Recall: 0.702) and a weighted F1 score of 0.679 (Precision: 0.685, Recall: 0.680). In future work, high-resolution objective chaos predictions from our model can be leveraged for basic science and intervention, including testing theorized mechanisms by which chaos affects children's cognition and behavior. Additionally, to facilitate further model development we make publicly available the first and largest balanced annotated audio dataset of real-world household chaos."
Identifying the presence and timing of discrete mood states prior to therapy.,32135317,Hannah G Bosley,University of California,N/A,"The present study tested a novel, person-specific method for identifying discrete mood profiles from time-series data, and examined the degree to which these profiles could be predicted by lagged mood and anxiety variables and time-based variables, including trends (linear, quadratic, cubic), cycles (12-hr, 24-hr, and 7-day), day of the week, and time of day. We analyzed ambulatory data from 45 individuals with mood and anxiety disorders prior to therapy. Data were collected four-times-daily for at least 30 days. Latent profile analysis was applied person-by-person to discretize each individual's continuous multivariate time series of rumination, worry, fear, anger, irritability, anhedonia, hopelessness, depressed mood, and avoidance. That is, each time point was classified according to its unique blend of emotional states, and latent classes representing discrete mood profiles were identified for each participant. We found that the modal number of latent classes per person was three (mean = 3.04, median = 3), with a range of two to four classes. After splitting each individual's time series into random halves for training and testing, we used elastic net regularization to identify the temporal and lagged predictors of each mood profile's presence or absence in the training set. Prediction accuracy was evaluated in the testing set. Across 127 models, the average area under the curve was 0.77, with sensitivity of 0.81 and specificity of 0.75. Brier scores indicated an average prediction accuracy of 83%."
What's in a trauma? Using machine learning to unpack what makes an event traumatic.,34378537,Payton J Jones,Harvard University,Department of Psychology,"What differentiates a trauma from an event that is merely upsetting? Wildly different definitions of trauma have been used in both formal (psychiatric) and informal (cultural, colloquial) settings. Yet there is a dearth of empirical work examining the features of events that individuals use to define an event as a 'trauma.' First, a group of qualitative coders classified features (e.g., actual physical injury, loss of possessions) of 600 event descriptions (e.g., ""was verbally harassed by a boss,"" ""watched a video of an adult being shot and killed""). Next, across two studies, machine learning was used to predict whether individuals rated event descriptions as 'trauma' or 'traumatic' in over 100,000 judgment tasks. In Study 1, examining continuous ratings from 'not at all traumatic' to 'extremely traumatic,' a cross-validated LASSO regression with polynomial features provided the best out-of-sample predictions (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.76), outperforming ridge regression, support vector regression, and linear regression. In Study 2, using binary judgments, a random forest model accurately predicted out-of-sample individual responses (AUC = 0.96), outperforming a neural network and an AdaBoost ensemble classifier. The most important event features across the two studies were actual death, threat of death, and the presence of a human perpetrator. The most important human features in predicting judgments were political orientation and gender."
Examining Online Behaviors of Adult-Child and Spousal Caregivers for People Living With Alzheimer Disease or Related Dementias: Comparative Study in an Open Online Community.,37976095,Zhijun Yin,Vanderbilt University,Department of Computer Science,"Alzheimer disease or related dementias (ADRD) are severe neurological disorders that impair the thinking and memory skills of older adults. Most persons living with dementia receive care at home from their family members or other unpaid informal caregivers; this results in significant mental, physical, and financial challenges for these caregivers. To combat these challenges, many informal ADRD caregivers seek social support in online environments. Although research examining online caregiving discussions is growing, few investigations have distinguished caregivers according to their kin relationships with persons living with dementias. Various studies have suggested that caregivers in different relationships experience distinct caregiving challenges and support needs. This study aims to examine and compare the online behaviors of adult-child and spousal caregivers, the 2 largest groups of informal ADRD caregivers, in an open online community. We collected posts from ALZConnected, an online community managed by the Alzheimer's Association. To gain insights into online behaviors, we first applied structural topic modeling to identify topics and topic prevalence between adult-child and spousal caregivers. Next, we applied VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) and LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) to evaluate sentiment changes in the online posts over time for both types of caregivers. We further built machine learning models to distinguish the posts of each caregiver type and evaluated them in terms of precision, recall, F<sub>1</sub>-score, and area under the precision-recall curve. Finally, we applied the best prediction model to compare the temporal trend of relationship-predicting capacities in posts between the 2 types of caregivers. Our analysis showed that the number of posts from both types of caregivers followed a long-tailed distribution, indicating that most caregivers in this online community were infrequent users. In comparison with adult-child caregivers, spousal caregivers tended to be more active in the community, publishing more posts and engaging in discussions on a wider range of caregiving topics. Spousal caregivers also exhibited slower growth in positive emotional communication over time. The best machine learning model for predicting adult-child, spousal, or other caregivers achieved an area under the precision-recall curve of 81.3%. The subsequent trend analysis showed that it became more difficult to predict adult-child caregiver posts than spousal caregiver posts over time. This suggests that adult-child and spousal caregivers might gradually shift their discussions from questions that are more directly related to their own experiences and needs to questions that are more general and applicable to other types of caregivers. Our findings suggest that it is important for researchers and community organizers to consider the heterogeneity of caregiving experiences and subsequent online behaviors among different types of caregivers when tailoring online peer support to meet the specific needs of each caregiver group."
Using machine learning with passive wearable sensors to pilot the detection of eating disorder behaviors in everyday life.,37859600,C A Levinson,University of Louisville,Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences,"Eating disorders (ED) are serious psychiatric disorders, taking a life every 52 minutes, with high relapse. There are currently no support or effective intervention therapeutics for individuals with an ED in their everyday life. The aim of this study is to build idiographic machine learning (ML) models to evaluate the performance of physiological recordings to detect individual ED behaviors in naturalistic settings. From an ongoing study (Final <i>N</i> = 120), we piloted the ability for ML to detect an individual's ED behavioral episodes (e.g. purging) from physiological data in six individuals diagnosed with an ED, all of whom endorsed purging. Participants wore an ambulatory monitor for 30 days and tapped a button to denote ED behavioral episodes. We built idiographic (<i>N</i> = 1) logistic regression classifiers (LRC) ML trained models to identify onset of episodes (~600 windows) v. baseline (~571 windows) physiology (Heart Rate, Electrodermal Activity, and Temperature). Using physiological data, ML LRC accurately classified on average 91% of cases, with 92% specificity and 90% sensitivity. This evidence suggests the ability to build idiographic ML models that detect ED behaviors from physiological indices within everyday life with a high level of accuracy. The novel use of ML with wearable sensors to detect physiological patterns of ED behavior pre-onset can lead to just-in-time clinical interventions to disrupt problematic behaviors and promote ED recovery."
Using Machine Learning of Online Expression to Explain Recovery Trajectories: Content Analytic Approach to Studying a Substance Use Disorder Forum.,37606984,Dhavan Shah,University of Wisconsin-Madison,Department of Psychology,"Smartphone-based apps are increasingly used to prevent relapse among those with substance use disorders (SUDs). These systems collect a wealth of data from participants, including the content of messages exchanged in peer-to-peer support forums. How individuals self-disclose and exchange social support in these forums may provide insight into their recovery course, but a manual review of a large corpus of text by human coders is inefficient. The study sought to evaluate the feasibility of applying supervised machine learning (ML) to perform large-scale content analysis of an online peer-to-peer discussion forum. Machine-coded data were also used to understand how communication styles relate to writers' substance use and well-being outcomes. Data were collected from a smartphone app that connects patients with SUDs to online peer support via a discussion forum. Overall, 268 adult patients with SUD diagnoses were recruited from 3 federally qualified health centers in the United States beginning in 2014. Two waves of survey data were collected to measure demographic characteristics and study outcomes: at baseline (before accessing the app) and after 6 months of using the app. Messages were downloaded from the peer-to-peer forum and subjected to manual content analysis. These data were used to train supervised ML algorithms using features extracted from the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) system to automatically identify the types of expression relevant to peer-to-peer support. Regression analyses examined how each expression type was associated with recovery outcomes. Our manual content analysis identified 7 expression types relevant to the recovery process (emotional support, informational support, negative affect, change talk, insightful disclosure, gratitude, and universality disclosure). Over 6 months of app use, 86.2% (231/268) of participants posted on the app's support forum. Of these participants, 93.5% (216/231) posted at least 1 message in the content categories of interest, generating 10,503 messages. Supervised ML algorithms were trained on the hand-coded data, achieving F<sub>1</sub>-scores ranging from 0.57 to 0.85. Regression analyses revealed that a greater proportion of the messages giving emotional support to peers was related to reduced substance use. For self-disclosure, a greater proportion of the messages expressing universality was related to improved quality of life, whereas a greater proportion of the negative affect expressions was negatively related to quality of life and mood. This study highlights a method of natural language processing with potential to provide real-time insights into peer-to-peer communication dynamics. First, we found that our ML approach allowed for large-scale content coding while retaining moderate-to-high levels of accuracy. Second, individuals' expression styles were associated with recovery outcomes. The expression types of emotional support, universality disclosure, and negative affect were significantly related to recovery outcomes, and attending to these dynamics may be important for appropriate intervention."
Stress response and experiential avoidance among firefighters: Preliminary insights from network analyses.,37499484,Katharina Schultebraucks,NYU Grossman School of Medicine,Department of Psychiatry,"Firefighters are at increased risk of developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to exposure to potentially traumatic events during their careers. However, little is known about the prevalence of PTSD among this population, particularly when taking moderating variables into account. Using Gaussian Graphical Models and Directed Acyclic Graphs, we conducted network analyses to examine the interactions between clusters of PTSD symptoms, perceived stress, hardiness, and experiential avoidance among 187 firefighters. The data and code are published with the paper. Experiential avoidance, as part of psychological inflexibility, was found to be the only variable that interacted with PTSD symptomatology. Strong positive associations were observed between experiential avoidance and the ""negative mood and cognitions"" subscale of the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Through this association, other PTSD symptoms were activated, particularly avoidance and arousal. Our findings suggest that experiential avoidance and negative mood and cognition symptoms are particularly important in the expression of PTSD symptomatology in firefighters. In addition, experiential avoidance may be used as a coping strategy to reduce perceived stress during potentially traumatic events. Therefore, experiential avoidance may be a prime target for future interventions and training focused on flexible self-regulation strategies in this population."
"Prediction of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Diagnosis Using Brief, Low-Cost Clinical Measures: A Competitive Model Evaluation.",37205171,Joel T Nigg,Oregon Health & Science University,Division of Psychology,"Proper diagnosis of ADHD is costly, requiring in-depth evaluation via interview, multi-informant and observational assessment, and scrutiny of possible other conditions. The increasing availability of data may allow the development of machine-learning algorithms capable of accurate diagnostic predictions using low-cost measures to supplement human decision-making. We report on the performance of multiple classification methods used to predict a clinician-consensus ADHD diagnosis. Methods ranged from fairly simple (e.g., logistic regression) to more complex (e.g., random forest), while emphasizing a multi-stage Bayesian approach. Classifiers were evaluated in two large (N>1000), independent cohorts. The multi-stage Bayesian classifier provides an intuitive approach consistent with clinical workflows, and was able to predict expert consensus ADHD diagnosis with high accuracy (>86%)-though not significantly better than other methods. Results suggest that parent and teacher surveys are sufficient for high-confidence classifications in the vast majority of cases, while an important minority require additional evaluation for accurate diagnosis."
The relationship between text message sentiment and self-reported depression.,34963643,Lyle H Ungar,University of Pennsylvania,Department of Computer and Information Science,"Personal sensing has shown promise for detecting behavioral correlates of depression, but there is little work examining personal sensing of cognitive and affective states. Digital language, particularly through personal text messages, is one source that can measure these markers. We correlated privacy-preserving sentiment analysis of text messages with self-reported depression symptom severity. We enrolled 219 U.S. adults in a 16 week longitudinal observational study. Participants installed a personal sensing app on their phones, which administered self-report PHQ-8 assessments of their depression severity, collected phone sensor data, and computed anonymized language sentiment scores from their text messages. We also trained machine learning models for predicting end-of-study self-reported depression status using on blocks of phone sensor and text features. In correlation analyses, we find that degrees of depression, emotional, and personal pronoun language categories correlate most strongly with self-reported depression, validating prior literature. Our classification models which predict binary depression status achieve a leave-one-out AUC of 0.72 when only considering text features and 0.76 when combining text with other networked smartphone sensors. Participants were recruited from a panel that over-represented women, caucasians, and individuals with self-reported depression at baseline. As language use differs across demographic factors, generalizability beyond this population may be limited. The study period also coincided with the initial COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, which may have affected smartphone sensor data quality. Effective depression prediction through text message sentiment, especially when combined with other personal sensors, could enable comprehensive mental health monitoring and intervention."
The Hidden Pandemic of Family Violence During COVID-19: Unsupervised Learning of Tweets.,33108315,Tingshao Zhu,Institute of Psychology,N/A,"Family violence (including intimate partner violence/domestic violence, child abuse, and elder abuse) is a hidden pandemic happening alongside COVID-19. The rates of family violence are rising fast, and women and children are disproportionately affected and vulnerable during this time. This study aims to provide a large-scale analysis of public discourse on family violence and the COVID-19 pandemic on Twitter. We analyzed over 1 million tweets related to family violence and COVID-19 from April 12 to July 16, 2020. We used the machine learning approach Latent Dirichlet Allocation and identified salient themes, topics, and representative tweets. We extracted 9 themes from 1,015,874 tweets on family violence and the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) increased vulnerability: COVID-19 and family violence (eg, rising rates, increases in hotline calls, homicide); (2) types of family violence (eg, child abuse, domestic violence, sexual abuse); (3) forms of family violence (eg, physical aggression, coercive control); (4) risk factors linked to family violence (eg, alcohol abuse, financial constraints, guns, quarantine); (5) victims of family violence (eg, the LGBTQ [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning] community, women, women of color, children); (6) social services for family violence (eg, hotlines, social workers, confidential services, shelters, funding); (7) law enforcement response (eg, 911 calls, police arrest, protective orders, abuse reports); (8) social movements and awareness (eg, support victims, raise awareness); and (9) domestic violence-related news (eg, Tara Reade, Melissa DeRosa). This study overcomes limitations in the existing scholarship where data on the consequences of COVID-19 on family violence are lacking. We contribute to understanding family violence during the pandemic by providing surveillance via tweets. This is essential for identifying potentially useful policy programs that can offer targeted support for victims and survivors as we prepare for future outbreaks."
Detecting mild cognitive impairment and dementia in older adults using naturalistic driving data and interaction-based classification from influence score.,36990588,Guohua Li,Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health,Department of Epidemiology,"Several recent studies indicate that atypical changes in driving behaviors appear to be early signs of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. These studies, however, are limited by small sample sizes and short follow-up duration. This study aims to develop an interaction-based classification method building on a statistic named Influence Score (i.e., I-score) for prediction of MCI and dementia using naturalistic driving data collected from the Longitudinal Research on Aging Drivers (LongROAD) project. Naturalistic driving trajectories were collected through in-vehicle recording devices for up to 44 months from 2977 participants who were cognitively intact at the time of enrollment. These data were further processed and aggregated to generate 31 time-series driving variables. Because of high dimensional time-series features for driving variables, we used I-score for variable selection. I-score is a measure to evaluate variables' ability to predict and is proven to be effective in differentiating between noisy and predictive variables in big data. It is introduced here to select influential variable modules or groups that account for compound interactions among explanatory variables. It is explainable regarding to what extent variables and their interactions contribute to the predictiveness of a classifier. In addition, I-score boosts the performance of classifiers over imbalanced datasets due to its association with the F1 score. Using predictive variables selected by I-score, interaction-based residual blocks are constructed over top I-score modules to generate predictors and ensemble learning aggregates these predictors to boost the prediction of the overall classifier. Experiments using naturalistic driving data show that our proposed classification method achieves the best accuracy (96%) for predicting MCI and dementia, followed by random forest (93%) and logistic regression (88%). In terms of F1 score and AUC, our proposed classifier achieves 98% and 87%, respectively, followed by random forest (with an F1 score of 96% and an AUC of 79%) and logistic regression (with an F1 score of 92% and an AUC of 77%). The results indicate that incorporating I-score into machine learning algorithms could considerably improve the model performance for predicting MCI and dementia in older drivers. We also performed the feature importance analysis and found that the right to left turn ratio and the number of hard braking events are the most important driving variables to predict MCI and dementia."
An electroencephalographic signature predicts antidepressant response in major depression.,32042166,Amit Etkin,Stanford University,Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences,"Antidepressants are widely prescribed, but their efficacy relative to placebo is modest, in part because the clinical diagnosis of major depression encompasses biologically heterogeneous conditions. Here, we sought to identify a neurobiological signature of response to antidepressant treatment as compared to placebo. We designed a latent-space machine-learning algorithm tailored for resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) and applied it to data from the largest imaging-coupled, placebo-controlled antidepressant study (n = 309). Symptom improvement was robustly predicted in a manner both specific for the antidepressant sertraline (versus placebo) and generalizable across different study sites and EEG equipment. This sertraline-predictive EEG signature generalized to two depression samples, wherein it reflected general antidepressant medication responsivity and related differentially to a repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment outcome. Furthermore, we found that the sertraline resting-state EEG signature indexed prefrontal neural responsivity, as measured by concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation and EEG. Our findings advance the neurobiological understanding of antidepressant treatment through an EEG-tailored computational model and provide a clinical avenue for personalized treatment of depression."
Fairness in the prediction of acute postoperative pain using machine learning models.,36714611,Patrick J Tighe,University of Florida College of Medicine,Department of Anesthesiology,"Overall performance of machine learning-based prediction models is promising; however, their generalizability and fairness must be vigorously investigated to ensure they perform sufficiently well for all patients. This study aimed to evaluate prediction bias in machine learning models used for predicting acute postoperative pain. We conducted a retrospective review of electronic health records for patients undergoing orthopedic surgery from June 1, 2011, to June 30, 2019, at the University of Florida Health system/Shands Hospital. CatBoost machine learning models were trained for predicting the binary outcome of low (≤4) and high pain (>4). Model biases were assessed against seven protected attributes of age, sex, race, area deprivation index (ADI), speaking language, health literacy, and insurance type. Reweighing of protected attributes was investigated for reducing model bias compared with base models. Fairness metrics of equal opportunity, predictive parity, predictive equality, statistical parity, and overall accuracy equality were examined. The final dataset included 14,263 patients [age: 60.72 (16.03) years, 53.87% female, 39.13% low acute postoperative pain]. The machine learning model (area under the curve, 0.71) was biased in terms of age, race, ADI, and insurance type, but not in terms of sex, language, and health literacy. Despite promising overall performance in predicting acute postoperative pain, machine learning-based prediction models may be biased with respect to protected attributes. These findings show the need to evaluate fairness in machine learning models involved in perioperative pain before they are implemented as clinical decision support tools."
Word usage in spontaneous speech as a predictor of depressive symptoms among youth at high risk for mood disorders.,36528134,David J Miklowitz,UCLA Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior,N/A,"We examined whether digital phenotyping of spontaneous speech, such as the use of specific word categories during speech samples, was associated with depressive symptoms in youth who were at familial and clinical risk for mood disorders. Participants (ages 13-19) had active mood symptoms, mood instability, and at least one parent with bipolar or major depressive disorder. During a randomized trial of family-focused therapy, participants were instructed to make weekly calls to a central voice server and leave speech samples in response to automated prompts. We coded youths' speech samples with the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count system and used machine learning to identify the combination of speech features that were most closely associated with the course of depressive symptoms over 18 weeks. A total of 253 speech samples were collected from 44 adolescents (mean age = 15.8 years; SD = 1.6) over 18 weeks. Speech containing affective processes, social processes, drives toward risk or reward, nonfluencies, and time orientation words were correlated with depressive symptoms at concurrent time periods (ps < 0.01). Machine learning analyses revealed that affective processes, nonfluencies, drives and risk words combined to most strongly predict changes in depressive symptoms over 18 weeks of treatment. Study results were limited by the small sample and the exclusion of paralinguistic or contextual variables in analyzing speech samples. In youth at high risk for mood disorders, knowledge of speech patterns may inform prognoses during outpatient psychosocial treatment."
Detection of Suicidality Among Opioid Users on Reddit: Machine Learning-Based Approach.,33245287,Fusheng Wang,Stony Brook University,N/A,"In recent years, both suicide and overdose rates have been increasing. Many individuals who struggle with opioid use disorder are prone to suicidal ideation; this may often result in overdose. However, these fatal overdoses are difficult to classify as intentional or unintentional. Intentional overdose is difficult to detect, partially due to the lack of predictors and social stigmas that push individuals away from seeking help. These individuals may instead use web-based means to articulate their concerns. This study aimed to extract posts of suicidality among opioid users on Reddit using machine learning methods. The performance of the models is derivative of the data purity, and the results will help us to better understand the rationale of these users, providing new insights into individuals who are part of the opioid epidemic. Reddit posts between June 2017 and June 2018 were collected from r/suicidewatch, r/depression, a set of opioid-related subreddits, and a control subreddit set. We first classified suicidal versus nonsuicidal languages and then classified users with opioid usage versus those without opioid usage. Several traditional baselines and neural network (NN) text classifiers were trained using subreddit names as the labels and combinations of semantic inputs. We then attempted to extract out-of-sample data belonging to the intersection of suicide ideation and opioid abuse. Amazon Mechanical Turk was used to provide labels for the out-of-sample data. Classification results were at least 90% across all models for at least one combination of input; the best classifier was convolutional neural network, which obtained an F<sub>1</sub> score of 96.6%. When predicting out-of-sample data for posts containing both suicidal ideation and signs of opioid addiction, NN classifiers produced more false positives and traditional methods produced more false negatives, which is less desirable for predicting suicidal sentiments. Opioid abuse is linked to the risk of unintentional overdose and suicide risk. Social media platforms such as Reddit contain metadata that can aid machine learning and provide information at a personal level that cannot be obtained elsewhere. We demonstrate that it is possible to use NNs as a tool to predict an out-of-sample target with a model built from data sets labeled by characteristics we wish to distinguish in the out-of-sample target."
Personalized Prediction of Response to Smartphone-Delivered Meditation Training: Randomized Controlled Trial.,36346668,Simon B Goldberg,University of Wisconsin - Madison,Center for Healthy Minds,"Meditation apps have surged in popularity in recent years, with an increasing number of individuals turning to these apps to cope with stress, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. Meditation apps are the most commonly used mental health apps for depression and anxiety. However, little is known about who is well suited to these apps. This study aimed to develop and test a data-driven algorithm to predict which individuals are most likely to benefit from app-based meditation training. Using randomized controlled trial data comparing a 4-week meditation app (Healthy Minds Program [HMP]) with an assessment-only control condition in school system employees (n=662), we developed an algorithm to predict who is most likely to benefit from HMP. Baseline clinical and demographic characteristics were submitted to a machine learning model to develop a ""Personalized Advantage Index"" (PAI) reflecting an individual's expected reduction in distress (primary outcome) from HMP versus control. A significant group × PAI interaction emerged (t<sub>658</sub>=3.30; P=.001), indicating that PAI scores moderated group differences in outcomes. A regression model that included repetitive negative thinking as the sole baseline predictor performed comparably well. Finally, we demonstrate the translation of a predictive model into personalized recommendations of expected benefit. Overall, the results revealed the potential of a data-driven algorithm to inform which individuals are most likely to benefit from a meditation app. Such an algorithm could be used to objectively communicate expected benefits to individuals, allowing them to make more informed decisions about whether a meditation app is appropriate for them.

Who will respond to intensive PTSD treatment? A machine learning approach to predicting response prior to starting treatment.,35468429,Dale L Smith,Rush University Medical Center,Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences,"Despite the established effectiveness of evidence-based PTSD treatments, not everyone responds the same. Specifically, some individuals respond early while others respond minimally throughout treatment. Our ability to predict these trajectories at baseline has been limited. Predicting which individuals will respond to a certain type of treatment can significantly reduce short- and long-term costs and increase the ability to preemptively match individuals with treatments to which they are most likely to respond. In the present study, we examined whether veterans' responses to a 3-week Cognitive Processing Therapy-based intensive PTSD treatment program could be accurately predicted prior to the first session. Using a sample of 432 veterans, and a wide range of demographic and clinical data collected during intake, we assessed six machine learning and statistical methods and their ability to predict fast and minimal responders prior to treatment initiation. For fast response classification, gradient boosted models (GBM) had the highest AUC-PR (0.466). For minimal response classification, elastic net (EN) had the highest mean CV AUC-PR (0.628). Using the best performing classifiers, we were able to predict both fast and minimal responders prior to starting treatment with relatively high AUC-ROC of 0.765 (GBM) and 0.826 (EN), respectively. These results may inform treatment modifications, although the accuracy may not be sufficient for clinicians to base inclusion/exclusion decisions entirely on the classifiers. Future research should evaluate whether these classifiers can be expanded to predict to which treatment type(s) an individual is most likely to respond based on various clinical, circumstantial, and biological features."
From promise to practice: towards the realisation of AI-informed mental health care.,36229346,Munmun De Choudhury,Georgia Institute of Technology,School of Interactive Computing,"In this Series paper, we explore the promises and challenges of artificial intelligence (AI)-based precision medicine tools in mental health care from clinical, ethical, and regulatory perspectives. The real-world implementation of these tools is increasingly considered the prime solution for key issues in mental health, such as delayed, inaccurate, and inefficient care delivery. Similarly, machine-learning-based empirical strategies are becoming commonplace in psychiatric research because of their potential to adequately deconstruct the biopsychosocial complexity of mental health disorders, and hence to improve nosology of prognostic and preventive paradigms. However, the implementation steps needed to translate these promises into practice are currently hampered by multiple interacting challenges. These obstructions range from the current technology-distant state of clinical practice, over the lack of valid real-world databases required to feed data-intensive AI algorithms, to model development and validation considerations being disconnected from the core principles of clinical utility and ethical acceptability. In this Series paper, we provide recommendations on how these challenges could be addressed from an interdisciplinary perspective to pave the way towards a framework for mental health care, leveraging the combined strengths of human intelligence and AI."

Using machine learning with intensive longitudinal data to predict depression and suicidal ideation among medical interns over time.,36177889,Ewa K Czyz,University of Michigan,Department of Psychiatry,"Use of intensive longitudinal methods (e.g. ecological momentary assessment, passive sensing) and machine learning (ML) models to predict risk for depression and suicide has increased in recent years. However, these studies often vary considerably in length, ML methods used, and sources of data. The present study examined predictive accuracy for depression and suicidal ideation (SI) as a function of time, comparing different combinations of ML methods and data sources. Participants were 2459 first-year training physicians (55.1% female; 52.5% White) who were provided with Fitbit wearable devices and assessed daily for mood. Linear [elastic net regression (ENR)] and non-linear (random forest) ML algorithms were used to predict depression and SI at the first-quarter follow-up assessment, using two sets of variables (daily mood features only, daily mood features + passive-sensing features). To assess accuracy over time, models were estimated iteratively for each of the first 92 days of internship, using data available up to that point in time. ENRs using only the daily mood features generally had the best accuracy for predicting mental health outcomes, and predictive accuracy within 1 standard error of the full 92 day models was attained by weeks 7-8. Depression at 92 days could be predicted accurately (area under the curve >0.70) after only 14 days of data collection. Simpler ML methods may outperform more complex methods until passive-sensing features become better specified. For intensive longitudinal studies, there may be limited predictive value in collecting data for more than 2 months."
"Impact of online mental health screening tools on help-seeking, care receipt, and suicidal ideation and suicidal intent: Evidence from internet search behavior in a large U.S. cohort.",33199054,Paul J Barr,Dartmouth College,Center for Technology and Behavioral Health,"Most people with psychiatric illnesses do not receive treatment for almost a decade after disorder onset. Online mental health screens reflect one mechanism designed to shorten this lag in help-seeking, yet there has been limited research on the effectiveness of screening tools in naturalistic settings. We examined a cohort of persons directed to a mental health screening tool via the Bing search engine (n = 126,060). We evaluated the impact of tool content on later searches for mental health self-references, self-diagnosis, care seeking, psychoactive medications, suicidal ideation, and suicidal intent. Website characteristics were evaluated by pairs of independent raters to ascertain screen type and content. These included the presence/absence of a suggestive diagnosis, a message on interpretability, as well as referrals to digital treatments, in-person treatments, and crisis services. Using machine learning models, the results suggested that screen content predicted later searches with mental health self-references (AUC = 0·73), mental health self-diagnosis (AUC = 0·69), mental health care seeking (AUC = 0·61), psychoactive medications (AUC = 0·55), suicidal ideation (AUC = 0·58), and suicidal intent (AUC = 0·60). Cox-proportional hazards models suggested individuals utilizing tools with in-person care referral were significantly more likely to subsequently search for methods to actively end their life (HR = 1·727, p = 0·007). Online screens may influence help-seeking behavior, suicidal ideation, and suicidal intent. Websites with referrals to in-person treatments could put persons at greater risk of active suicidal intent. Further evaluation using large-scale randomized controlled trials is needed."
The signature-testing approach to mapping biological and artificial intelligences.,35773138,Colin Allen,University of Pittsburgh,Department of History and Philosophy of Science,"Making inferences from behaviour to cognition is problematic due to a many-to-one mapping problem, in which any one behaviour can be generated by multiple possible cognitive processes. Attempts to cross this inferential gap when comparing human intelligence to that of animals or machines can generate great debate. Here, we discuss the challenges of making comparisons using 'success-testing' approaches and call attention to an alternate experimental framework, the 'signature-testing' approach. Signature testing places the search for information-processing errors, biases, and other patterns centre stage, rather than focussing predominantly on problem-solving success. We highlight current research on both biological and artificial intelligence that fits within this framework and is creating proactive research programs that make strong inferences about the similarities and differences between the content of human, animal, and machine minds."
Prediction of the trajectories of depressive symptoms among children in the adolescent brain cognitive development (ABCD) study using machine learning approach.,35545159,Xiaobo Zhou,University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston,School of Biomedical Informatics,"Depression often first emerges during adolescence and evidence shows that the long-term patterns of depressive symptoms over time are heterogeneous. It is meaningful to predict the trajectory of depressive symptoms in adolescents to find early intervention targets. Based on the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study, we included 4962 participants aged 9-10 who were followed-up for 2 years. Trajectories of depressive symptoms were identified by Latent Class Growth Analyses (LCGA). Four types of machine learning models were built to predict the identified trajectories and to obtain variables with predictive value based on the best performance model. Of all participants, 536 (10.80%) were classified as increasing, 269 (5.42%) as persistently high, 433 (8.73%) as decreasing, and 3724 (75.05%) as persistently low by LCGA. Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model got the highest discriminant performance. Sleep quality, parental emotional state and family financial adversities were the most important predictors and three resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging functional connectivity data were also helpful to distinguish trajectories. We only have depressive symptom scores at three time points. Some valuable predictors are not specific to depression. External validation is an important next step. These predictors should not be interpreted as etiology and some variables were reported by parents/caregivers. Using GBM combined with baseline characteristics, the trajectories of depressive symptoms with two years among adolescents aged 9-10 years can be well predicted, which might further facilitate the identification of adolescents at high risk of depressive symptoms and development of effective early interventions."
Evaluation of an artificial intelligence-based medical device for diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.,35513550,Sharief Taraman,CHOC Children's,N/A,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be reliably diagnosed at 18 months, yet significant diagnostic delays persist in the United States. This double-blinded, multi-site, prospective, active comparator cohort study tested the accuracy of an artificial intelligence-based Software as a Medical Device designed to aid primary care healthcare providers (HCPs) in diagnosing ASD. The Device combines behavioral features from three distinct inputs (a caregiver questionnaire, analysis of two short home videos, and an HCP questionnaire) in a gradient boosted decision tree machine learning algorithm to produce either an ASD positive, ASD negative, or indeterminate output. This study compared Device outputs to diagnostic agreement by two or more independent specialists in a cohort of 18-72-month-olds with developmental delay concerns (425 study completers, 36% female, 29% ASD prevalence). Device output PPV for all study completers was 80.8% (95% confidence intervals (CI), 70.3%-88.8%) and NPV was 98.3% (90.6%-100%). For the 31.8% of participants who received a determinate output (ASD positive or negative) Device sensitivity was 98.4% (91.6%-100%) and specificity was 78.9% (67.6%-87.7%). The Device's indeterminate output acts as a risk control measure when inputs are insufficiently granular to make a determinate recommendation with confidence. If this risk control measure were removed, the sensitivity for all study completers would fall to 51.6% (63/122) (95% CI 42.4%, 60.8%), and specificity would fall to 18.5% (56/303) (95% CI 14.3%, 23.3%). Among participants for whom the Device abstained from providing a result, specialists identified that 91% had one or more complex neurodevelopmental disorders. No significant differences in Device performance were found across participants' sex, race/ethnicity, income, or education level. For nearly a third of this primary care sample, the Device enabled timely diagnostic evaluation with a high degree of accuracy. The Device shows promise to significantly increase the number of children able to be diagnosed with ASD in a primary care setting, potentially facilitating earlier intervention and more efficient use of specialist resources."

Brain morphometric features predict medication response in youth with bipolar disorder: a prospective randomized clinical trial.,35392995,Melissa P DelBello,University of Cincinnati College of Medicine,Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience,"Identification of treatment-specific predictors of drug therapies for bipolar disorder (BD) is important because only about half of individuals respond to any specific medication. However, medication response in pediatric BD is variable and not well predicted by clinical characteristics. A total of 121 youth with early course BD (acute manic/mixed episode) were prospectively recruited and randomized to 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with quetiapine (<i>n</i> = 71) or lithium (<i>n</i> = 50). Participants completed structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline before treatment and 1 week after treatment initiation, and brain morphometric features were extracted for each individual based on MRI scans. Positive antimanic treatment response at week 6 was defined as an over 50% reduction of Young Mania Rating Scale scores from baseline. Two-stage deep learning prediction model was established to distinguish responders and non-responders based on different feature sets. Pre-treatment morphometry and morphometric changes occurring during the first week can both independently predict treatment outcome of quetiapine and lithium with balanced accuracy over 75% (all <i>p</i> < 0.05). Combining brain morphometry at baseline and week 1 allows prediction with the highest balanced accuracy (quetiapine: 83.2% and lithium: 83.5%). Predictions in the quetiapine and lithium group were found to be driven by different morphometric patterns. These findings demonstrate that pre-treatment morphometric measures and acute brain morphometric changes can serve as medication response predictors in pediatric BD. Brain morphometric features may provide promising biomarkers for developing biologically-informed treatment outcome prediction and patient stratification tools for BD treatment development."
Computational ethics.,35365430,Josh B Tenenbaum,Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences,"Technological advances are enabling roles for machines that present novel ethical challenges. The study of 'AI ethics' has emerged to confront these challenges, and connects perspectives from philosophy, computer science, law, and economics. Less represented in these interdisciplinary efforts is the perspective of cognitive science. We propose a framework - computational ethics - that specifies how the ethical challenges of AI can be partially addressed by incorporating the study of human moral decision-making. The driver of this framework is a computational version of reflective equilibrium (RE), an approach that seeks coherence between considered judgments and governing principles. The framework has two goals: (i) to inform the engineering of ethical AI systems, and (ii) to characterize human moral judgment and decision-making in computational terms. Working jointly towards these two goals will create the opportunity to integrate diverse research questions, bring together multiple academic communities, uncover new interdisciplinary research topics, and shed light on centuries-old philosophical questions."
Predictors of nonfatal suicide attempts within 30 days of discharge from psychiatric hospitalization: Sex-specific models developed using population-based registries.,35304235,Jaimie L Gradus,Boston University School of Medicine,Department of Psychiatry,"Risk for nonfatal suicide attempts is heightened in the month after psychiatric hospitalization discharge. Investigations of factors associated with such attempts are limited. We conducted a case-subcohort study using data from Danish medical, administrative, and social registries to develop sex-specific risk models using two machine learning methods: classification trees and random forests. Cases included individuals who received a diagnostic code for a nonfatal suicide attempt within 30 days of discharge following a psychiatric hospitalization between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2015 (n = 3166, 56.5% female). The comparison subcohort consisted of a 5% random sample of individuals living in Denmark (n = 24,559, 51.3% female) on January 1, 1995 who had a psychiatric hospitalization during the study period. Histories of self-poisoning, substance-related disorders, and eating disorders were important predictors of nonfatal suicide attempt among women, with notable interactions observed between age, self-poisoning history, and other characteristics (e.g., medication use). Self-poisoning, substance-related disorders, and severe stress reactions were among the most important variables for men, with key interactions noted between self-poisoning history, age, major depressive disorder diagnosis, and prescription classes. Findings are based on Danish administrative data, which may be subject to inaccuracies, missingness, etc. It is unclear whether results would generalize to other populations. Markers of behavioral dysregulation were important predictors of nonfatal suicide attempts in the 30 days after psychiatric hospitalization discharge for both sexes. Examining risk markers for nonfatal suicide attempt following discharge is important to enhance support for this vulnerable population."
High Predictive Accuracy of Negative Schizotypy With Acoustic Measures.,38031625,Jeffrey S Bedwell,University of Central Florida.,Department of Psychology,"Negative schizotypal traits potentially can be digitally phenotyped using objective vocal analysis. Prior attempts have shown mixed success in this regard, potentially because acoustic analysis has relied on small, constrained feature sets. We employed machine learning to (a) optimize and cross-validate predictive models of self-reported negative schizotypy using a large acoustic feature set, (b) evaluate model performance as a function of sex and speaking task, (c) understand potential mechanisms underlying negative schizotypal traits by evaluating the key acoustic features within these models, and (d) examine model performance in its convergence with clinical symptoms and cognitive functioning. Accuracy was good (> 80%) and was improved by considering speaking task and sex. However, the features identified as most predictive of negative schizotypal traits were generally not considered critical to their conceptual definitions. Implications for validating and implementing digital phenotyping to understand and quantify negative schizotypy are discussed."
The relationship between text message sentiment and self-reported depression.,34963643,Lyle H Ungar,University of Pennsylvania,Department of Computer and Information Science,"Personal sensing has shown promise for detecting behavioral correlates of depression, but there is little work examining personal sensing of cognitive and affective states. Digital language, particularly through personal text messages, is one source that can measure these markers. We correlated privacy-preserving sentiment analysis of text messages with self-reported depression symptom severity. We enrolled 219 U.S. adults in a 16 week longitudinal observational study. Participants installed a personal sensing app on their phones, which administered self-report PHQ-8 assessments of their depression severity, collected phone sensor data, and computed anonymized language sentiment scores from their text messages. We also trained machine learning models for predicting end-of-study self-reported depression status using on blocks of phone sensor and text features. In correlation analyses, we find that degrees of depression, emotional, and personal pronoun language categories correlate most strongly with self-reported depression, validating prior literature. Our classification models which predict binary depression status achieve a leave-one-out AUC of 0.72 when only considering text features and 0.76 when combining text with other networked smartphone sensors. Participants were recruited from a panel that over-represented women, caucasians, and individuals with self-reported depression at baseline. As language use differs across demographic factors, generalizability beyond this population may be limited. The study period also coincided with the initial COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, which may have affected smartphone sensor data quality. Effective depression prediction through text message sentiment, especially when combined with other personal sensors, could enable comprehensive mental health monitoring and intervention."
Unsupervised EEG Artifact Detection and Correction.,34713069,Mohammad M Ghassemi,Michigan State University,Human Augmentation and Artificial Intelligence Lab,"Electroencephalography (EEG) is used in the diagnosis, monitoring, and prognostication of many neurological ailments including seizure, coma, sleep disorders, brain injury, and behavioral abnormalities. One of the primary challenges of EEG data is its sensitivity to a breadth of non-stationary noises caused by physiological-, movement-, and equipment-related artifacts. Existing solutions to artifact <i>detection</i> are deficient because they require experts to manually explore and annotate data for artifact segments. Existing solutions to artifact <i>correction</i> or removal are deficient because they assume that the incidence and specific characteristics of artifacts are similar across both subjects and tasks (i.e., ""one-size-fits-all""). In this paper, we describe a novel EEG noise-reduction method that uses representation learning to perform patient- and task-specific artifact detection and correction. More specifically, our method extracts 58 clinically relevant features and applies an ensemble of unsupervised outlier detection algorithms to identify EEG artifacts that are unique to a given task and subject. The artifact segments are then passed to a deep encoder-decoder network for unsupervised <i>artifact correction</i>. We compared the performance of classification models trained with and without our method and observed a 10% relative improvement in performance when using our approach. Our method provides a flexible end-to-end unsupervised framework that can be applied to novel EEG data without the need for expert supervision and can be used for a variety of clinical decision tasks, including coma prognostication and degenerative illness detection. By making our method, code, and data publicly available, our work provides a tool that is of both immediate practical utility and may also serve as an important foundation for future efforts in this domain."
The Hidden Pandemic of Family Violence During COVID-19: Unsupervised Learning of Tweets.,33108315,Tingshao Zhu,Institute of Psychology,N/A,"Family violence (including intimate partner violence/domestic violence, child abuse, and elder abuse) is a hidden pandemic happening alongside COVID-19. The rates of family violence are rising fast, and women and children are disproportionately affected and vulnerable during this time. This study aims to provide a large-scale analysis of public discourse on family violence and the COVID-19 pandemic on Twitter. We analyzed over 1 million tweets related to family violence and COVID-19 from April 12 to July 16, 2020. We used the machine learning approach Latent Dirichlet Allocation and identified salient themes, topics, and representative tweets. We extracted 9 themes from 1,015,874 tweets on family violence and the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) increased vulnerability: COVID-19 and family violence (eg, rising rates, increases in hotline calls, homicide); (2) types of family violence (eg, child abuse, domestic violence, sexual abuse); (3) forms of family violence (eg, physical aggression, coercive control); (4) risk factors linked to family violence (eg, alcohol abuse, financial constraints, guns, quarantine); (5) victims of family violence (eg, the LGBTQ [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning] community, women, women of color, children); (6) social services for family violence (eg, hotlines, social workers, confidential services, shelters, funding); (7) law enforcement response (eg, 911 calls, police arrest, protective orders, abuse reports); (8) social movements and awareness (eg, support victims, raise awareness); and (9) domestic violence-related news (eg, Tara Reade, Melissa DeRosa). This study overcomes limitations in the existing scholarship where data on the consequences of COVID-19 on family violence are lacking. We contribute to understanding family violence during the pandemic by providing surveillance via tweets. This is essential for identifying potentially useful policy programs that can offer targeted support for victims and survivors as we prepare for future outbreaks."
What's in a trauma? Using machine learning to unpack what makes an event traumatic.,34378537,Payton J Jones,Harvard University,Department of Psychology,"What differentiates a trauma from an event that is merely upsetting? Wildly different definitions of trauma have been used in both formal (psychiatric) and informal (cultural, colloquial) settings. Yet there is a dearth of empirical work examining the features of events that individuals use to define an event as a 'trauma.' First, a group of qualitative coders classified features (e.g., actual physical injury, loss of possessions) of 600 event descriptions (e.g., ""was verbally harassed by a boss,"" ""watched a video of an adult being shot and killed""). Next, across two studies, machine learning was used to predict whether individuals rated event descriptions as 'trauma' or 'traumatic' in over 100,000 judgment tasks. In Study 1, examining continuous ratings from 'not at all traumatic' to 'extremely traumatic,' a cross-validated LASSO regression with polynomial features provided the best out-of-sample predictions (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.76), outperforming ridge regression, support vector regression, and linear regression. In Study 2, using binary judgments, a random forest model accurately predicted out-of-sample individual responses (AUC = 0.96), outperforming a neural network and an AdaBoost ensemble classifier. The most important event features across the two studies were actual death, threat of death, and the presence of a human perpetrator. The most important human features in predicting judgments were political orientation and gender."
Finding warning markers: Leveraging natural language processing and machine learning technologies to detect risk of school violence.,32361146,Michael Sorter,College of Medicine,Department of Pediatrics,"School violence has a far-reaching effect, impacting the entire school population including staff, students and their families. Among youth attending the most violent schools, studies have reported higher dropout rates, poor school attendance, and poor scholastic achievement. It was noted that the largest crime-prevention results occurred when youth at elevated risk were given an individualized prevention program. However, much work is needed to establish an effective approach to identify at-risk subjects. In our earlier research, we developed a risk assessment program to interview subjects, identify risk and protective factors, and evaluate risk for school violence. This study focused on developing natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning technologies to automate the risk assessment process. We prospectively recruited 131 students with or without behavioral concerns from 89 schools between 05/01/2015 and 04/30/2018. The subjects were interviewed with two risk assessment scales and a questionnaire, and their risk of violence were determined by pediatric psychiatrists based on clinical judgment. Using NLP technologies, different types of linguistic features were extracted from the interview content. Machine learning classifiers were then applied to predict risk of school violence for individual subjects. A two-stage feature selection was implemented to identify violence-related predictors. The performance was validated on the psychiatrist-generated reference standard of risk levels, where positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity (SEN), negative predictive value (NPV), specificity (SPEC) and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were assessed. Compared to subjects' sociodemographic information, use of linguistic features significantly improved classifiers' predictive performance (P < 0.01). The best-performing classifier with n-gram features achieved 86.5 %/86.5 %/85.7 %/85.7 %/94.0 % (PPV/SEN/NPV/SPEC/AUC) on the cross-validation set and 83.3 %/93.8 %/91.7 %/78.6 %/94.6 % (PPV/SEN/NPV/SPEC/AUC) on the test data. The feature selection process identified a set of predictors covering the discussion of subjects' thoughts, perspectives, behaviors, individual characteristics, peers and family dynamics, and protective factors. By analyzing the content from subject interviews, the NLP and machine learning algorithms showed good capacity for detecting risk of school violence. The feature selection uncovered multiple warning markers that could deliver useful clinical insights to assist personalizing intervention. Consequently, the developed approach offered the promise of an accurate and scalable computerized screening service for preventing school violence."
Rationalizing constraints on the capacity for cognitive control.,34332856,Jonathan D Cohen,Princeton Neuroscience Institute,N/A,"Humans are remarkably limited in: (i) how many control-dependent tasks they can execute simultaneously, and (ii) how intensely they can focus on a single task. These limitations are universal assumptions of most theories of cognition. Yet, a rationale for why humans are subject to these constraints remains elusive. This feature review draws on recent insights from psychology, neuroscience, and machine learning, to suggest that constraints on cognitive control may result from a rational adaptation to fundamental, computational dilemmas in neural architectures. The reviewed literature implies that limitations in multitasking may result from a trade-off between learning efficacy and processing efficiency and that limitations in the intensity of commitment to a single task may reflect a trade-off between cognitive stability and flexibility."
Predicting response to Cognitive Processing Therapy for PTSD: A machine-learning approach.,34252700,Tara E Galovski,National Center for PTSD Women's Health Sciences Division,National Center for PTSD Women's Health Sciences Division,"Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) is an effective treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); however, not every client achieves optimal outcomes. Data were pooled from four randomized trials in which female interpersonal trauma survivors completed CPT (N = 179). Random forests of classification trees were used to investigate the role of both baseline (e.g., demographics, trauma history, comorbid disorders) and session PTSD and depressive symptom scores on predicting trajectory and outcome. Of particular focus was whether those on track for poor outcome (e.g., non-response, partial treatment response) could be identified early in therapy. Results demonstrated inconsistent findings for discrimination between delayed responders (no early change but full response after 12 weeks of therapy) and those who either showed a partial response to treatment or did not respond at all; level of discrimination depended on the assessment point under study and the chosen comparison group. Those defined as clear and early responders, however, could be reliably differentiated from the other groups by session 4. Although it is possible to identify clients who will recover from PTSD by the middle of the CPT protocol, further work is needed to accurately identify those who will ultimately not recover from PTSD during a course of CPT."
Using Tweets to Understand How COVID-19-Related Health Beliefs Are Affected in the Age of Social Media: Twitter Data Analysis Study.,33529155,Yuan Luo,Northwestern University,Department of Preventive Medicine,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (ie, COVID-19) has given rise to a global pandemic affecting 215 countries and over 40 million people as of October 2020. Meanwhile, we are also experiencing an infodemic induced by the overabundance of information, some accurate and some inaccurate, spreading rapidly across social media platforms. Social media has arguably shifted the information acquisition and dissemination of a considerably large population of internet users toward higher interactivities. This study aimed to investigate COVID-19-related health beliefs on one of the mainstream social media platforms, Twitter, as well as potential impacting factors associated with fluctuations in health beliefs on social media. We used COVID-19-related posts from the mainstream social media platform Twitter to monitor health beliefs. A total of 92,687,660 tweets corresponding to 8,967,986 unique users from January 6 to June 21, 2020, were retrieved. To quantify health beliefs, we employed the health belief model (HBM) with four core constructs: perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers. We utilized natural language processing and machine learning techniques to automate the process of judging the conformity of each tweet with each of the four HBM constructs. A total of 5000 tweets were manually annotated for training the machine learning architectures. The machine learning classifiers yielded areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves over 0.86 for the classification of all four HBM constructs. Our analyses revealed a basic reproduction number R<sub>0</sub> of 7.62 for trends in the number of Twitter users posting health belief-related content over the study period. The fluctuations in the number of health belief-related tweets could reflect dynamics in case and death statistics, systematic interventions, and public events. Specifically, we observed that scientific events, such as scientific publications, and nonscientific events, such as politicians' speeches, were comparable in their ability to influence health belief trends on social media through a Kruskal-Wallis test (P=.78 and P=.92 for perceived benefits and perceived barriers, respectively). As an analogy of the classic epidemiology model where an infection is considered to be spreading in a population with an R<sub>0</sub> greater than 1, we found that the number of users tweeting about COVID-19 health beliefs was amplifying in an epidemic manner and could partially intensify the infodemic. It is ""unhealthy"" that both scientific and nonscientific events constitute no disparity in impacting the health belief trends on Twitter, since nonscientific events, such as politicians' speeches, might not be endorsed by substantial evidence and could sometimes be misleading."
Individualized identification of first-episode bipolar disorder using machine learning and cognitive tests.,33445089,Bo Cao,University of Alberta,Department of Psychiatry,"Identifying cognitive dysfunction in the early stages of Bipolar Disorder (BD) can allow for early intervention. Previous studies have shown a strong correlation between cognitive dysfunction and number of manic episodes. The objective of this study was to apply machine learning (ML) techniques on a battery of cognitive tests to identify first-episode BD patients (FE-BD). Two cohorts of participants were used for this study. Cohort #1 included 74 chronic BD patients (CHR-BD) and 53 healthy controls (HC), while the Cohort #2 included 37 FE-BD and 18 age- and sex-matched HC. Cognitive functioning was assessed using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). The tests examined domains of visual processing, spatial memory, attention and executive function. We trained an ML model to distinguish between chronic BD patients (CHR-BD) and HC at the individual level. We used linear Support Vector Machines (SVM) and were able to identify individual CHR-BD patients at 77% accuracy. We then applied the model to Cohort #2 (FE-BD patients) and achieved an accuracy of 76% (AUC = 0.77). These results reveal that cognitive impairments may appear in early stages of BD and persist into later stages. This suggests that the same deficits may exist for both CHR-BD and FE-BD. These cognitive deficits may serve as markers for early BD. Our study provides a tool that these early markers can be used for detection of BD."
Detection of Suicidality Among Opioid Users on Reddit: Machine Learning-Based Approach.,33245287,Fusheng Wang,Stony Brook University,N/A,"In recent years, both suicide and overdose rates have been increasing. Many individuals who struggle with opioid use disorder are prone to suicidal ideation; this may often result in overdose. However, these fatal overdoses are difficult to classify as intentional or unintentional. Intentional overdose is difficult to detect, partially due to the lack of predictors and social stigmas that push individuals away from seeking help. These individuals may instead use web-based means to articulate their concerns. This study aimed to extract posts of suicidality among opioid users on Reddit using machine learning methods. The performance of the models is derivative of the data purity, and the results will help us to better understand the rationale of these users, providing new insights into individuals who are part of the opioid epidemic. Reddit posts between June 2017 and June 2018 were collected from r/suicidewatch, r/depression, a set of opioid-related subreddits, and a control subreddit set. We first classified suicidal versus nonsuicidal languages and then classified users with opioid usage versus those without opioid usage. Several traditional baselines and neural network (NN) text classifiers were trained using subreddit names as the labels and combinations of semantic inputs. We then attempted to extract out-of-sample data belonging to the intersection of suicide ideation and opioid abuse. Amazon Mechanical Turk was used to provide labels for the out-of-sample data. Classification results were at least 90% across all models for at least one combination of input; the best classifier was convolutional neural network, which obtained an F<sub>1</sub> score of 96.6%. When predicting out-of-sample data for posts containing both suicidal ideation and signs of opioid addiction, NN classifiers produced more false positives and traditional methods produced more false negatives, which is less desirable for predicting suicidal sentiments. Opioid abuse is linked to the risk of unintentional overdose and suicide risk. Social media platforms such as Reddit contain metadata that can aid machine learning and provide information at a personal level that cannot be obtained elsewhere. We demonstrate that it is possible to use NNs as a tool to predict an out-of-sample target with a model built from data sets labeled by characteristics we wish to distinguish in the out-of-sample target."
Quantitative Methods for Analyzing Intimate Partner Violence in Microblogs: Observational Study.,33211021,Cecilia Ovesdotter Alm,Rochester Institute of Technology,N/A,"Social media is a rich, virtually untapped source of data on the dynamics of intimate partner violence, one that is both global in scale and intimate in detail. The aim of this study is to use machine learning and other computational methods to analyze social media data for the reasons victims give for staying in or leaving abusive relationships. Human annotation, part-of-speech tagging, and machine learning predictive models, including support vector machines, were used on a Twitter data set of 8767 #WhyIStayed and #WhyILeft tweets each. Our methods explored whether we can analyze micronarratives that include details about victims, abusers, and other stakeholders, the actions that constitute abuse, and how the stakeholders respond. Our findings are consistent across various machine learning methods, which correspond to observations in the clinical literature, and affirm the relevance of natural language processing and machine learning for exploring issues of societal importance in social media."
"Impact of online mental health screening tools on help-seeking, care receipt, and suicidal ideation and suicidal intent: Evidence from internet search behavior in a large U.S. cohort.",33199054,Paul J Barr,Dartmouth College,Center for Technology and Behavioral Health,"Most people with psychiatric illnesses do not receive treatment for almost a decade after disorder onset. Online mental health screens reflect one mechanism designed to shorten this lag in help-seeking, yet there has been limited research on the effectiveness of screening tools in naturalistic settings. We examined a cohort of persons directed to a mental health screening tool via the Bing search engine (n = 126,060). We evaluated the impact of tool content on later searches for mental health self-references, self-diagnosis, care seeking, psychoactive medications, suicidal ideation, and suicidal intent. Website characteristics were evaluated by pairs of independent raters to ascertain screen type and content. These included the presence/absence of a suggestive diagnosis, a message on interpretability, as well as referrals to digital treatments, in-person treatments, and crisis services. Using machine learning models, the results suggested that screen content predicted later searches with mental health self-references (AUC = 0·73), mental health self-diagnosis (AUC = 0·69), mental health care seeking (AUC = 0·61), psychoactive medications (AUC = 0·55), suicidal ideation (AUC = 0·58), and suicidal intent (AUC = 0·60). Cox-proportional hazards models suggested individuals utilizing tools with in-person care referral were significantly more likely to subsequently search for methods to actively end their life (HR = 1·727, p = 0·007). Online screens may influence help-seeking behavior, suicidal ideation, and suicidal intent. Websites with referrals to in-person treatments could put persons at greater risk of active suicidal intent. Further evaluation using large-scale randomized controlled trials is needed."
Deep learning-based classification of posttraumatic stress disorder and depression following trauma utilizing visual and auditory markers of arousal and mood.,32744201,Isaac R Galatzer-Levy,New York University Grossman School of Medicine,Department of Psychiatry,"Visual and auditory signs of patient functioning have long been used for clinical diagnosis, treatment selection, and prognosis. Direct measurement and quantification of these signals can aim to improve the consistency, sensitivity, and scalability of clinical assessment. Currently, we investigate if machine learning-based computer vision (CV), semantic, and acoustic analysis can capture clinical features from free speech responses to a brief interview 1 month post-trauma that accurately classify major depressive disorder (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). N = 81 patients admitted to an emergency department (ED) of a Level-1 Trauma Unit following a life-threatening traumatic event participated in an open-ended qualitative interview with a para-professional about their experience 1 month following admission. A deep neural network was utilized to extract facial features of emotion and their intensity, movement parameters, speech prosody, and natural language content. These features were utilized as inputs to classify PTSD and MDD cross-sectionally. Both video- and audio-based markers contributed to good discriminatory classification accuracy. The algorithm discriminates PTSD status at 1 month after ED admission with an AUC of 0.90 (weighted average precision = 0.83, recall = 0.84, and f1-score = 0.83) as well as depression status at 1 month after ED admission with an AUC of 0.86 (weighted average precision = 0.83, recall = 0.82, and f1-score = 0.82). Direct clinical observation during post-trauma free speech using deep learning identifies digital markers that can be utilized to classify MDD and PTSD status."
Detecting risk of suicide attempts among Chinese medical college students using a machine learning algorithm.,32421600,Xiangyang Zhang,The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston,Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences,"Suicide has become one of the most prominent concerns for public health and wellness; however, detecting suicide risk factors among individuals remains a big challenge.

Digital Biomarkers of Social Anxiety Severity: Digital Phenotyping Using Passive Smartphone Sensors.,32348284,Sabine Wilhelm,Massachusetts General Hospital,Harvard Medical School,"Social anxiety disorder is a highly prevalent and burdensome condition. Persons with social anxiety frequently avoid seeking physician support and rarely receive treatment. Social anxiety symptoms are frequently underreported and underrecognized, creating a barrier to the accurate assessment of these symptoms. Consequently, more research is needed to identify passive biomarkers of social anxiety symptom severity. Digital phenotyping, the use of passive sensor data to inform health care decisions, offers a possible method of addressing this assessment barrier. This study aims to determine whether passive sensor data acquired from smartphone data can accurately predict social anxiety symptom severity using a publicly available dataset. In this study, participants (n=59) completed self-report assessments of their social anxiety symptom severity, depressive symptom severity, positive affect, and negative affect. Next, participants installed an app, which passively collected data about their movement (accelerometers) and social contact (incoming and outgoing calls and texts) over 2 weeks. Afterward, these passive sensor data were used to form digital biomarkers, which were paired with machine learning models to predict participants' social anxiety symptom severity. The results suggested that these passive sensor data could be utilized to accurately predict participants' social anxiety symptom severity (r=0.702 between predicted and observed symptom severity) and demonstrated discriminant validity between depression, negative affect, and positive affect. These results suggest that smartphone sensor data may be utilized to accurately detect social anxiety symptom severity and discriminate social anxiety symptom severity from depressive symptoms, negative affect, and positive affect."
Using machine learning to classify suicide attempt history among youth in medical care settings.,32174479,Guy Diamond,Drexel University,Center for Family Intervention Science,"The current study aimed to classify recent and lifetime suicide attempt history among youth presenting to medical settings using machine learning (ML) as applied to a behavioral health screen self-report survey. In the current study, 13,325 (mean age = 17.06, SD = 2.61) pediatric primary care patients from rural, semi-urban, and urban areas of Pennsylvania and 12,001 (mean age = 15.79, SD = 1.40) pediatric patients from an urban children's hospital emergency department were included in the analyses. We used two methods of ML (decision trees, random forests) to (a) generate algorithms to classify suicide attempt history, and (b) validate generated algorithms within and across samples to assess model performance. We also employed ridge regression to evaluate performance of the ML approaches. Our findings demonstrate that ML approaches did not enhance our ability to classify lifetime or recent suicide attempt history among youth across medical care settings, suggesting that relationships may be mainly linear and non-interactive. In line with prior research, a history of suicide planning, active suicidal ideation, passive suicidal ideation, and nonsuicidal self-injury emerged as relatively important correlates of suicide attempt. The cross-sectional nature of the current study prevents us from determining the extent to which the important variables identified confer risk for future suicidal behavior. The present study underscores the importance of suicide risk screenings that focus on the assessment of active and passive suicidal ideation and suicide planning, in addition to nonsuicidal self-injury, across pediatric medical settings."
Identifying the presence and timing of discrete mood states prior to therapy.,32135317,Hannah G Bosley,University of California,N/A,"The present study tested a novel, person-specific method for identifying discrete mood profiles from time-series data, and examined the degree to which these profiles could be predicted by lagged mood and anxiety variables and time-based variables, including trends (linear, quadratic, cubic), cycles (12-hr, 24-hr, and 7-day), day of the week, and time of day. We analyzed ambulatory data from 45 individuals with mood and anxiety disorders prior to therapy. Data were collected four-times-daily for at least 30 days. Latent profile analysis was applied person-by-person to discretize each individual's continuous multivariate time series of rumination, worry, fear, anger, irritability, anhedonia, hopelessness, depressed mood, and avoidance. That is, each time point was classified according to its unique blend of emotional states, and latent classes representing discrete mood profiles were identified for each participant. We found that the modal number of latent classes per person was three (mean = 3.04, median = 3), with a range of two to four classes. After splitting each individual's time series into random halves for training and testing, we used elastic net regularization to identify the temporal and lagged predictors of each mood profile's presence or absence in the training set. Prediction accuracy was evaluated in the testing set. Across 127 models, the average area under the curve was 0.77, with sensitivity of 0.81 and specificity of 0.75. Brier scores indicated an average prediction accuracy of 83%."
Machine learning enhances prediction of illness course: a longitudinal study in eating disorders.,32108564,Scott J Crow,University of Minnesota,Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences,"Psychiatric disorders, including eating disorders (EDs), have clinical outcomes that range widely in severity and chronicity. The ability to predict such outcomes is extremely limited. Machine-learning (ML) approaches that model complexity may optimize the prediction of multifaceted psychiatric behaviors. However, the investigations of many psychiatric concerns have not capitalized on ML to improve prognosis. This study conducted the first comparison of an ML approach (elastic net regularized logistic regression) to traditional regression to longitudinally predict ED outcomes. Females with heterogeneous ED diagnoses completed demographic and psychiatric assessments at baseline (<i>n</i> = 415) and Year 1 (<i>n</i> = 320) and 2 (<i>n</i> = 277) follow-ups. Elastic net and traditional logistic regression models comprising the same baseline variables were compared in ability to longitudinally predict ED diagnosis, binge eating, compensatory behavior, and underweight BMI at Years 1 and 2. Elastic net models had higher accuracy for all outcomes at Years 1 and 2 [average Area Under the Receiving Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC) = 0.78] compared to logistic regression (average AUC = 0.67). Model performance did not deteriorate when the most important predictor was removed or an alternative ML algorithm (random forests) was applied. Baseline ED (e.g. diagnosis), psychiatric (e.g. hospitalization), and demographic (e.g. ethnicity) characteristics emerged as important predictors in exploratory predictor importance analyses. ML algorithms can enhance the prediction of ED symptoms for 2 years and may identify important risk markers. The superior accuracy of ML for predicting complex outcomes suggests that these approaches may ultimately aid in advancing precision medicine for serious psychiatric disorders."
An electroencephalographic signature predicts antidepressant response in major depression.,32042166,Amit Etkin,Stanford University,Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences,"Antidepressants are widely prescribed, but their efficacy relative to placebo is modest, in part because the clinical diagnosis of major depression encompasses biologically heterogeneous conditions. Here, we sought to identify a neurobiological signature of response to antidepressant treatment as compared to placebo. We designed a latent-space machine-learning algorithm tailored for resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) and applied it to data from the largest imaging-coupled, placebo-controlled antidepressant study (n = 309). Symptom improvement was robustly predicted in a manner both specific for the antidepressant sertraline (versus placebo) and generalizable across different study sites and EEG equipment. This sertraline-predictive EEG signature generalized to two depression samples, wherein it reflected general antidepressant medication responsivity and related differentially to a repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment outcome. Furthermore, we found that the sertraline resting-state EEG signature indexed prefrontal neural responsivity, as measured by concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation and EEG. Our findings advance the neurobiological understanding of antidepressant treatment through an EEG-tailored computational model and provide a clinical avenue for personalized treatment of depression."
Artificial intelligence and the future of psychiatry: Insights from a global physician survey.,31980092,Kaylee Bodner,Duke University School of Medicine,Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences,"Futurists have predicted that new autonomous technologies, embedded with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), will lead to substantial job losses in many sectors disrupting many aspects of healthcare. Mental health appears ripe for such disruption given the global illness burden, stigma, and shortage of care providers. To characterize the global psychiatrist community's opinion regarding the potential of future autonomous technology (referred to here as AI/ML) to replace key tasks carried out in mental health practice. Cross sectional, random stratified sample of psychiatrists registered with Sermo, a global networking platform open to verified and licensed physicians. We measured opinions about the likelihood that AI/ML tools would be able to fully replace - not just assist - the average psychiatrist in performing 10 key psychiatric tasks. Among those who considered replacement likely, we measured opinions about how many years from now such a capacity might emerge. We also measured psychiatrist's perceptions about whether benefits of AI/ML would outweigh the risks. Survey respondents were 791 psychiatrists from 22 countries representing North America, South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. Only 3.8 % of respondents felt it was likely that future technology would make their jobs obsolete and only 17 % felt that future AI/ML was likely to replace a human clinician for providing empathetic care. Documenting and updating medical records (75 %) and synthesizing information (54 %) were the two tasks where a majority predicted that AI/ML could fully replace human psychiatrists. Female- and US-based doctors were more uncertain that the benefits of AI would outweigh risks than male- and non-US doctors, respectively. Around one in 2 psychiatrists did however predict that their jobs would be substantially changed by AI/ML. Our findings provide compelling insights into how physicians think about AI/ML which in turn may help us better integrate technology and reskill doctors to enhance mental health care."
