Using deep learning to predict internalizing problems from brain structure in youth.,40654936,Azadeh Kushki,Bloorview Research Institute,N/A,"Internalizing problems (e.g., anxiety and depression) are associated with a wide range of adverse outcomes. While some predictors of internalizing problems are known (e.g., their frequent co-occurrence with neurodevelopmental (ND) conditions), the biological markers of internalizing problems are not well understood. Here, we used deep learning, a powerful tool for identifying complex and multi-dimensional brain-behaviour relationships, to predict cross-sectional and worsening longitudinal trajectories of internalizing problems. Data were extracted from four large-scale datasets: the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study, the Healthy Brain Network, the Human Connectome Project Development study, and the Province of Ontario Neurodevelopmental network. We developed deep learning models that used measures of brain structure (thickness, surface area, and volume) to (a) predict clinically significant internalizing problems cross-sectionally (<i>N</i>=14,523); and (b) predict subsequent worsening trajectories (using the reliable change index) of internalizing problems (<i>N</i>=10,540) longitudinally. A stratified cross-validation scheme was used to tune, train, and test the models, which were evaluated using the area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC). The cross-sectional model performed well across the sample, reaching an AUC of 0.80[95% CI: 0.71,0.88]. For the longitudinal model, while performance was sub-optimal for predicting worsening trajectories in a sample of the general population (AUC=0.66[0.65,0.67]), good performance was achieved in a small, external test set of primarily ND conditions (AUC=0.80[0.78,0.81]), as well as across all ND conditions (AUC=0.73[0.70,0.76]). Deep learning with features of brain structure is a promising avenue for biomarkers of internalizing problems, particularly for individuals who have a higher likelihood of experiencing difficulties."
Radiomics in pediatric brain tumors: from images to insights.,40817158,Abhishek Mahajan,The Clatterbridge Cancer Centre NHS Foundation Trust,Department of Imaging,"Radiomics has emerged as a promising non-invasive imaging approach in pediatric neuro-oncology, offering the ability to extract high-dimensional quantitative features from routine MRI to support diagnosis, risk stratification, molecular characterization, and outcome prediction. Pediatric brain tumors, which differ significantly from adult tumors in biology and imaging appearance, present unique diagnostic and prognostic challenges. By integrating radiomics with machine learning algorithms, studies have demonstrated strong performance in classifying tumor types such as medulloblastoma, ependymoma, and gliomas, and predicting molecular subgroups and mutations such as H3K27M and BRAF. Recent studies combining radiomics with machine learning algorithms - including support vector machines, random forests, and deep learning CNNs - have demonstrated promising performance, with AUCs ranging from 0.75 to 0.98 for tumor classification and 0.77 to 0.88 for molecular subgroup prediction, across cohorts from 50 to over 450 patients, with internal cross-validation and external validation in some cases. In resource-limited settings or regions with limited radiologist manpower, radiomics-based tools could help augment diagnostic accuracy and consistency, serving as decision support to prioritize patients for further evaluation or biopsy. Emerging applications such as radio-immunomics and radio-pathomics may further enhance understanding of tumor biology but remain investigational. Despite its potential, clinical translation faces notable barriers, including limited pediatric-specific datasets, variable imaging protocols, and the lack of standardized, reproducible workflows. Multi-institutional collaboration, harmonized pipelines, and prospective validation are essential next steps. Radiomics should be viewed as a supplementary tool that complements existing clinical and pathological frameworks, supporting more informed and equitable care in pediatric brain tumor management."
Addressing multi-site functional MRI heterogeneity through dual-expert collaborative learning for brain disease identification.,37227019,Mingxia Liu,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,Department of Radiology and BRIC,"Several studies employ multi-site rs-fMRI data for major depressive disorder (MDD) identification, with a specific site as the to-be-analyzed target domain and other site(s) as the source domain. But they usually suffer from significant inter-site heterogeneity caused by the use of different scanners and/or scanning protocols and fail to build generalizable models that can well adapt to multiple target domains. In this article, we propose a dual-expert fMRI harmonization (DFH) framework for automated MDD diagnosis. Our DFH is designed to simultaneously exploit data from a single labeled source domain/site and two unlabeled target domains for mitigating data distribution differences across domains. Specifically, the DFH consists of a domain-generic student model and two domain-specific teacher/expert models that are jointly trained to perform knowledge distillation through a deep collaborative learning module. A student model with strong generalizability is finally derived, which can be well adapted to unseen target domains and analysis of other brain diseases. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first attempts to investigate multi-target fMRI harmonization for MDD diagnosis. Comprehensive experiments on 836 subjects with rs-fMRI data from 3 different sites show the superiority of our method. The discriminative brain functional connectivities identified by our method could be regarded as potential biomarkers for fMRI-related MDD diagnosis."
MICCAI-CDMRI 2023 QuantConn Challenge Findings on Achieving Robust Quantitative Connectivity through Harmonized Preprocessing of Diffusion MRI.,39606717,Bennett A Landman,Vanderbilt University,Department of Computer Science,"White matter alterations are increasingly implicated in neurological diseases and their progression. International-scale studies use diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) to qualitatively identify changes in white matter microstructure and connectivity. Yet, quantitative analysis of DW-MRI data is hindered by inconsistencies stemming from varying acquisition protocols. Specifically, there is a pressing need to harmonize the preprocessing of DW-MRI datasets to ensure the derivation of robust quantitative diffusion metrics across acquisitions. In the MICCAI-CDMRI 2023 QuantConn challenge, participants were provided raw data from the same individuals collected on the same scanner but with two different acquisitions and tasked with preprocessing the DW-MRI to minimize acquisition differences while retaining biological variation. Harmonized submissions are evaluated on the reproducibility and comparability of cross-acquisition bundle-wise microstructure measures, bundle shape features, and connectomics. The key innovations of the QuantConn challenge are that (1) we assess bundles and tractography in the context of harmonization for the first time, (2) we assess connectomics in the context of harmonization for the first time, and (3) we have 10x additional subjects over prior harmonization challenge, MUSHAC and 100x over SuperMUDI. We find that bundle surface area, fractional anisotropy, connectome assortativity, betweenness centrality, edge count, modularity, nodal strength, and participation coefficient measures are most biased by acquisition and that machine learning voxel-wise correction, RISH mapping, and NeSH methods effectively reduce these biases. In addition, microstructure measures AD, MD, RD, bundle length, connectome density, efficiency, and path length are least biased by these acquisition differences. A machine learning approach that learned voxel-wise cross-acquisition relationships was the most effective at harmonizing connectomic, microstructure, and macrostructure features, but requires the same subject be scanned at each site co-registered. NeSH, a spatial and angular resampling method, was also effective and has generalizable framework not reliant co-registration.

Prediction of Postoperative Delirium in Older Adults from Preoperative Cognition and Occipital Alpha Power from Resting-State Electroencephalogram.,39185530,Mouhsin M Shafi,Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,Berenson-Allen Center for Noninvasive Brain Stimulation,"Postoperative delirium is the most common complication following surgery among older adults, and has been consistently associated with increased mortality and morbidity, cognitive decline, and loss of independence, as well as markedly increased health-care costs. Electroencephalography (EEG) spectral slowing has frequently been observed during episodes of delirium, whereas intraoperative frontal alpha power is associated with postoperative delirium. We sought to identify preoperative predictors that could identify individuals at high risk for postoperative delirium, which could guide clinical decision-making and enable targeted interventions to potentially decrease delirium incidence and postoperative delirium-related complications. In this prospective observational study, we used machine learning to evaluate whether baseline (preoperative) cognitive function and resting-state EEG could be used to identify patients at risk for postoperative delirium. Preoperative resting-state EEGs and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment were collected from 85 patients (age = 73 ± 6.4 years, 12 cases of delirium) undergoing elective surgery. The model with the highest f1-score was subsequently validated in an independent, prospective cohort of 51 older adults (age = 68 ± 5.2 years, 6 cases of delirium) undergoing elective surgery. Occipital alpha powers have higher f1-score than frontal alpha powers and EEG spectral slowing in the training cohort. Occipital alpha powers were able to predict postoperative delirium with AUC, specificity and accuracy all >90%, and sensitivity >80%, in the validation cohort. Notably, models incorporating transformed alpha powers and cognitive scores outperformed models incorporating occipital alpha powers alone or cognitive scores alone. While requiring prospective validation in larger cohorts, these results suggest that strong prediction of postoperative delirium may be feasible in clinical settings using simple and widely available clinical tools. Additionally, our results suggested that the thalamocortical circuit exhibits different EEG patterns under different stressors, with occipital alpha powers potentially reflecting baseline vulnerabilities."
"Multi-photon, label-free photoacoustic and optical imaging of NADH in brain cells.",40775235,Peter T C So,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Department of Mechanical Engineering,"Label-free detection of biological events at single-cell resolution in the brain can non-invasively capture brain status for medical diagnosis and basic neuroscience research. NADH is an universal coenzyme that not only plays a central role in cellular metabolism but may also be used as a biomarker to capture metabolic processes in brain cells and structures. We have developed a new label-free, multiphoton photoacoustic microscope (LF-MP-PAM) with a near-infrared femtosecond laser to observe endogenous NAD(P)H in living cells. The imaging depth of NAD(P)H in tissues with all-optical methods is limited to ~100 μm in brain tissue by the strong absorption of the near-ultraviolet fluorescence. Here, acoustic detection of the thermal signature of multi-photon (three-photon) excitation of NAD(P)H, a low quantum yield fluorophore, allows detection at an unprecedented depth while the focused excitation ensures high spatial resolution. We validated the photoacoustic detection of NAD(P)H by monitoring an increase in intracellular NAD(P)H in HEK293T cells and HepG2 cells incubated in NADH solution. We also demonstrated the detection of endogenous NAD(P)H photoacoustic signals in brain slices to 700 μm depth and in cerebral organoids to 1100 μm depth. Finally, we developed and demonstrated simultaneous photoacoustic and optical imaging of NAD(P)H in brain cells with a real-time image acquisition and processing pipeline. This approach could open a new door to monitor brain metabolic changes during development and disease, and changes due to neuronal activity, at single-cell level deep in the brains of both humans and animals."
Effective connectivity between the cerebellum and fronto-temporal regions correctly classify major depressive disorder: fMRI study using a multi-site dataset.,40609648,Bihong T Chen,City of Hope National Medical Center,Department of Diagnostic Radiology,"Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) diagnosis mainly relies on subjective self-reporting and clinical assessments. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and its analysis of Effective Connectivity (EC) offer a quantitative approach to understand the directional interactions between brain regions, presenting a potential objective method for MDD classification. Granger causality analysis was used to extract EC features from a large, multi-site rs-fMRI dataset of MDD patients. The ComBat algorithm was applied to adjust for site differences, while multivariate linear regression was employed to control for age and sex differences. Discriminative EC features for MDD were identified using two-sample t-tests and model-based feature selection, with the LightGBM algorithm being used for classification. The performance and generalizability of the model was evaluated using nested five-fold cross-validation and tested for generalizability on an independent dataset. Ninety-seven EC features belonging to the cerebellum and front-temporal regions were identified as highly discriminative for MDD. The classification model using these features achieved an accuracy of 94.35 %, with a sensitivity of 93.52 % and specificity of 95.25 % in cross-validation. Generalization of the model to an independent dataset resulted in an accuracy of 94.74 %, sensitivity of 90.59 %, and specificity of 96.75 %. The study demonstrates that EC features from rs-fMRI can effectively discriminate MDD from healthy controls, suggesting that EC analysis could be a valuable tool in assisting the clinical diagnosis of MDD. This method shows promise in enhancing the objectivity of MDD diagnosis through the use of neuroimaging biomarkers."
Neurodevelopmental subtypes of functional brain organization in the ABCD study using a rigorous analytic framework.,39245397,Marie T Banich,University of Colorado Boulder,Department of Psychology and Neuroscience,"The current study demonstrates that an individual's resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) is a dependable biomarker for identifying differential patterns of cognitive and emotional functioning during late childhood. Using baseline RSFC data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, which includes children aged 9-11, we identified four distinct RSFC subtypes. We introduce an integrated methodological pipeline for testing the reliability and importance of these subtypes. In the Identification phase, Leiden Community Detection defined RSFC subtypes, with their reproducibility confirmed through a split-sample technique in the Validation stage. The Evaluation phase showed that distinct cognitive and mental health profiles are associated with each subtype, with the Predictive phase indicating that subtypes better predict various cognitive and mental health characteristics than individual RSFC connections. The Replication stage employed bootstrapping and down-sampling methods to substantiate the reproducibility of these subtypes further. This work allows future explorations of developmental trajectories of these RSFC subtypes."
Treatment resistant recurrent unipolar and bipolar depression: associative learning abnormalities.,40755210,J Douglas Steele,University of Dundee,Division of Neuroscience,"Severe and enduring psychiatric illness affects about three percent of the UK population and is associated with significant disability and a substantial reduction in average life expectancy. Two types are treatment resistant recurrent unipolar depression and treatment resistant bipolar depression, the latter being the depressed phase of bipolar disorder. Different phenotypes and different responses to antidepressant medications suggest different neural abnormalities. As bipolar depression can be clinically indistinguishable from unipolar depression yet require different treatments, development of objective ways to discriminate these two illnesses are important. Here we used reinforcement learning drift diffusion models of decision making, and event-related fMRI acquired during a reward gain and loss avoidance task, to investigate patients with treatment resistant recurrent unipolar depression and bipolar depression, in long term General Adult Psychiatry follow up. We tested the null hypothesis that both unipolar and bipolar depressive illnesses show similarly blunted reward learning signals, and increased loss avoidance learning signals, with similar psychomotor slowing. Consistent with our null hypothesis, we found abnormally slowed decision making for both depression types, with individual patient reinforcement learning drift diffusion model parameter estimates correlating with depression severity. For unipolar depression, we found blunted outcome and value signals for positive feedback, and increased signals for negative feedback. However, in contrast to our null hypothesis, bipolar depression was associated with preserved striatal reward prediction error signalling, and an absence of hippocampal and lateral orbitofrontal enhanced encoding of loss events, which was present for unipolar depression. Overall then, both treatment resistant recurrent unipolar depression and treatment resistant bipolar depression showed a similar pattern of neural abnormality compared to controls for the lateral orbitofrontal cortex reward value signal and the amygdala loss value signal. However, the illnesses also differed significantly, particularly with regard to hippocampal, striatal, and lateral orbitofrontal function, potentially allowing objective discrimination. Using a support vector machine with the results of our neuroimaging analyses, it was also possible to differentiate the two depression types with an accuracy of 74.3%. Further studies of currently ill patients with severe and enduring illness are indicated."
Digital phenotyping from wearables using AI characterizes psychiatric disorders and identifies genetic associations.,39706190,Mark Gerstein,Yale University,N/A,"Psychiatric disorders are influenced by genetic and environmental factors. However, their study is hindered by limitations on precisely characterizing human behavior. New technologies such as wearable sensors show promise in surmounting these limitations in that they measure heterogeneous behavior in a quantitative and unbiased fashion. Here, we analyze wearable and genetic data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. Leveraging >250 wearable-derived features as digital phenotypes, we show that an interpretable AI framework can objectively classify adolescents with psychiatric disorders more accurately than previously possible. To relate digital phenotypes to the underlying genetics, we show how they can be employed in univariate and multivariate genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Doing so, we identify 16 significant genetic loci and 37 psychiatric-associated genes, including ELFN1 and ADORA3, demonstrating that continuous, wearable-derived features give greater detection power than traditional case-control GWASs. Overall, we show how wearable technology can help uncover new linkages between behavior and genetics."
Brain Age Is Not a Significant Predictor of Relapse Risk in Late-Life Depression.,39349179,Carmen Andreescu,University of Pittsburgh,Department of Psychiatry,"Late-life depression (LLD) has been associated cross-sectionally with lower brain structural volumes and accelerated brain aging compared with healthy control participants (HCs). There are few longitudinal studies on the neurobiological predictors of recurrence in LLD. We tested a machine learning brain age model and its prospective association with LLD recurrence risk. We recruited individuals with LLD (n = 102) and HCs (n = 43) into a multisite, 2-year longitudinal study. Individuals with LLD were enrolled within 4 months of remission. Remitted participants with LLD underwent baseline neuroimaging and longitudinal clinical follow-up. Over 2 years, 43 participants with LLD relapsed and 59 stayed in remission. We used a previously developed machine learning brain age algorithm to compute brain age at baseline, and we evaluated brain age group differences (HC vs. LLD and HC vs. remitted LLD vs. relapsed LLD). We conducted a Cox proportional hazards model to evaluate whether baseline brain age predicted time to relapse. We found that brain age did not significantly differ between the HC and LLD groups or between the HC, remitted LLD, and relapsed LLD groups. Brain age did not significantly predict time to relapse. In contrast to our hypothesis, we found that brain age did not differ between control participants without depression and individuals with remitted LLD, and brain age was not associated with subsequent recurrence. This is in contrast to existing literature which has identified baseline brain age differences in late life but consistent with work that has shown no differences between people who do and do not relapse on gross structural measures."
Predicting OCD severity from religiosity and personality: A machine learning and neural network approach.,40655911,Gregory N Muller,University of Texas at Austin,Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) affects a significant portion of the United States population. The present study investigated the complex relationships among OCD severity, personality traits, religiosity, and spirituality with a dataset of 229 participants. We applied advanced machine and deep learning techniques to identify key predictors of OCD severity, uncovering nuanced relationships and unexpected findings. Notably, item-level features were more influential than aggregate scores, challenging traditional analytical approaches. Moreover, a neural network model, despite not surpassing a linear regression in predictive accuracy, provided a more comprehensive understanding of OCD's heterogeneity and of the nonlinear relationships between our variables. The inclusion of demographic factors provided further explanatory power for predicting OCD severity, emphasizing the multifaceted nature of the disorder. Our results show that machine learning models can nearly match traditional linear models in predictive power while retaining nonlinear relationships essential to understanding OCD. Our study advocates for the adoption of sophisticated predictive models in examining complex psychological phenomena, encouraging a reevaluation of conventional analytical approaches when prediction is central to research questions."
Towards fair decentralized benchmarking of healthcare AI algorithms with the Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) challenge.,40628696,Spyridon Bakas,Indiana University,Center for Federated Learning in Medicine,"Computational competitions are the standard for benchmarking medical image analysis algorithms, but they typically use small curated test datasets acquired at a few centers, leaving a gap to the reality of diverse multicentric patient data. To this end, the Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) Challenge represents the paradigm for real-world algorithmic performance evaluation. The FeTS challenge is a competition to benchmark (i) federated learning aggregation algorithms and (ii) state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms, across multiple international sites. Weight aggregation and client selection techniques were compared using a multicentric brain tumor dataset in realistic federated learning simulations, yielding benefits for adaptive weight aggregation, and efficiency gains through client sampling. Quantitative performance evaluation of state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms on data distributed internationally across 32 institutions yielded good generalization on average, albeit the worst-case performance revealed data-specific modes of failure. Similar multi-site setups can help validate the real-world utility of healthcare AI algorithms in the future."
Gut microbiota composition is related to anxiety and aggression scores in companion dogs.,40624095,Carolyn J Walsh,Memorial University of Newfoundland,Department of Psychology,"There is mounting evidence for a link between behaviour and the gut microbiome in animal and human health. However, the role of the gut microbiome in the development and severity of behavioural issues in companion dogs is not yet fully understood. Here, we investigated the relationship between gut microbiota composition and aggression or anxiety in pet dogs. Dogs were assigned to higher or lower anxiety and aggression groups based on their owner's responses to the Canine Behavioral Assessment & Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ). Then, the gut microbiota composition of each animal, sequenced from microbial DNA extracted from fecal samples, was assessed for association with the dog's assigned behavioural group using multiple approaches. While minimal differences in relative abundance were seen between behavioural groups, machine-learning and compositional balance models could predict behavioural group based on gut microbiota composition. The genus Blautia was identified consistently across analyses, suggesting a link between this genus and anxiety in pet dogs. This study provides insight into specific bacteria that are linked to increased anxiety and aggression in pet dogs. Further research is required to identify bacteria to the species level, and to better understand the specific role of Blautia in the canine gut-brain axis."
Unveiling New Strategies Facilitating the Implementation of Artificial Intelligence in Neuroimaging for the Early Detection of Alzheimer's Disease.,38640152,Domenico Praticò,Temple University,Alzheimer's Center at Temple,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder with a global impact. The past few decades have witnessed significant strides in comprehending the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and developing diagnostic methodologies for AD, such as neuroimaging approaches. Neuroimaging techniques, including positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, have revolutionized the field by providing valuable insights into the structural and functional alterations in the brains of individuals with AD. These imaging modalities enable the detection of early biomarkers such as amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles, facilitating early and precise diagnosis. Furthermore, the emerging technologies encompassing blood-based biomarkers and neurochemical profiling exhibit promising results in the identification of specific molecular signatures for AD. The integration of machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence has enhanced the predictive capacity of these diagnostic tools when analyzing complex datasets. In this review article, we will highlight not only some of the most used diagnostic imaging approaches in neurodegeneration research but focus much more on new tools like artificial intelligence, emphasizing their application in the realm of AD. These advancements hold immense potential for early detection and intervention, thereby paving the way for personalized therapeutic strategies and ultimately augmenting the quality of life for individuals affected by AD."
Different prefrontal cortex activity patterns in bipolar and unipolar depression during verbal fluency tasks based on functional near infrared spectroscopy study.,40593067,Zhongxia Shen,Sleep Medical Center of Huzhou Third Municipal Hospital,Sleep Medical Center of Huzhou Third Municipal Hospital,"This study aimed to investigate the functionality of the prefrontal cortex in patients with unipolar depression (UD) and bipolar depression (BD) using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during a verbal fluency task (VFT). Additionally, it evaluated the reliability of fNIRS as a diagnostic tool for cognitive assessments through a deep learning approach using one-dimensional convolutional networks. The study included 73 patients with UD, 59 patients with BD, and 40 healthy controls (HC). Hemodynamic responses in the prefrontal cortex were recorded using fNIRS during the VFT. Differences in oxygenated hemoglobin concentrations across the three groups were compared, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for each region of interest. Both UD and BD patients demonstrated significantly reduced activation in the prefrontal cortex compared to healthy controls. UD patients showed notably lower activation values than BD patients in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, frontopolar prefrontal cortex, left orbitofrontal cortex, and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. The highest classification accuracy (79.57%) was observed in the left orbitofrontal cortex. The UD group had the largest area under the ROC curve (AUC = 0.99) in the left orbitofrontal cortex, while the BD group had the largest AUC (0.91) in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The HC group exhibited the largest AUC (0.73) in the same region. The DLPFC, FPC, lOFC, and lVLPFC may serve as biomarker regions for differentiating UD from BD. The combination of fNIRS and the VFT shows promise as a supplementary diagnostic tool for mental health disorders."
A comprehensive hybrid model: Combining bioinspired optimization and deep learning for Alzheimer's disease identification.,40580613,Saurav Mallik,Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health,Department of Environmental Health,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a gradual decline in cognitive ability and memory function. It is a progressive disease characterized by worsening dementia symptoms over time, starting with mild memory loss and advancing to severe impairments in communication and responsiveness. The key motive of this work is to explore the new hybrid technique with parameter tuning for segmenting the brain sub regions, by satisfying the clinical targets in finding major biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aims to explore a new bioinspired hybrid technique for segmenting various brain regions to assist in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. To refine the segmentation accuracy, a combination of Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO) and Harris Hawk Optimization (HHO) approaches is proposed. Initially, the population is divided into two smaller groups, designated HHO and GWO, where both methods update subpopulation positions concurrently. The segmented region (SR) is validated with ground truth (GT) using different statistical measures and shows the highlighted accuracy of 92 %. According to the experimental results, the proposed hybrid technique provides an improved solution than HHO. After segmentation, deep learning (DL) technique is applied to classify the normal controls (NC) and AD. A 90 % classification accuracy is achieved when HHO and GWO are combined. Finally, the results are validated with clinical score, namely Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), which gives the support to observe the disease progression. This process demonstrates the hybrid method and it proves with remarkable results, in segmentation, classification and clinical validation. In this work, clinicians have assisted in disease progression monitoring, thereby improving patient care. Significance: This work provides assistance to diagnose AD and doctors to make a decision for further treatment."
Deep learning identification of reward-related neural substrates of preadolescent irritability: A novel 3D CNN application for fMRI.,40567457,Jillian Lee Wiggins,San Diego State University/University of California,N/A,"The recent emergence of deep learning methods, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), applied to fMRI data presents a promising avenue in psychiatry research, offering advantages over traditional analyses by requiring minimal assumptions and enabling detection of higher-level patterns and intricate, nonlinear relationships within inherently complex fMRI data. Irritability, defined as a lowered threshold for angry responses to blocked rewards, is a promising neurodevelopmental marker for mental health risk due to its robust, transdiagnostic predictive power in youth. In this study, data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) baseline sample (<i>N</i> = 6065) were utilized for a novel application of a 3D CNN to whole-brain fMRI data acquired during the reward anticipation period of the monetary incentive delay task to predict parent-reported youth irritability severity, measured dimensionally. Regression activation mapping (RAM) was employed to extract feature maps of brain regions most predictive of irritability severity from the model. The model demonstrated satisfactory accuracy, with a mean squared error (MSE) of 1.82, and predicted irritability severity scores with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.48 ± 1.54 SD from the true scores. Notably, feature maps revealed bilateral representation of key regions implicated in emotional response and reward processing, including the caudate nucleus, amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, and hippocampus. This study underscores the potential for 3D CNNs to predict significant, dimensional clinical outcomes such as irritability severity using fMRI data."
Assessment of Neuroanatomical Endophenotypes of Autism Spectrum Disorder and Association With Characteristics of Individuals With Schizophrenia and the General Population.,37017948,Christos Davatzikos,University of Pennsylvania,AI 2 D Center for Data Science for Integrated Diagnostics,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with significant clinical, neuroanatomical, and genetic heterogeneity that limits precision diagnostics and treatment. To assess distinct neuroanatomical dimensions of ASD using novel semisupervised machine learning methods and to test whether the dimensions can serve as endophenotypes also in non-ASD populations. This cross-sectional study used imaging data from the publicly available Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) repositories as the discovery cohort. The ABIDE sample included individuals diagnosed with ASD aged between 16 and 64 years and age- and sex-match typically developing individuals. Validation cohorts included individuals with schizophrenia from the Psychosis Heterogeneity Evaluated via Dimensional Neuroimaging (PHENOM) consortium and individuals from the UK Biobank to represent the general population. The multisite discovery cohort included 16 internationally distributed imaging sites. Analyses were performed between March 2021 and March 2022. The trained semisupervised heterogeneity through discriminative analysis models were tested for reproducibility using extensive cross-validations. It was then applied to individuals from the PHENOM and the UK Biobank. It was hypothesized that neuroanatomical dimensions of ASD would display distinct clinical and genetic profiles and would be prominent also in non-ASD populations. Heterogeneity through discriminative analysis models trained on T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance images of 307 individuals with ASD (mean [SD] age, 25.4 [9.8] years; 273 [88.9%] male) and 362 typically developing control individuals (mean [SD] age, 25.8 [8.9] years; 309 [85.4%] male) revealed that a 3-dimensional scheme was optimal to capture the ASD neuroanatomy. The first dimension (A1: aginglike) was associated with smaller brain volume, lower cognitive function, and aging-related genetic variants (FOXO3; Z = 4.65; P = 1.62 × 10-6). The second dimension (A2: schizophrenialike) was characterized by enlarged subcortical volumes, antipsychotic medication use (Cohen d = 0.65; false discovery rate-adjusted P = .048), partially overlapping genetic, neuroanatomical characteristics to schizophrenia (n = 307), and significant genetic heritability estimates in the general population (n = 14 786; mean [SD] h2, 0.71 [0.04]; P < 1 × 10-4). The third dimension (A3: typical ASD) was distinguished by enlarged cortical volumes, high nonverbal cognitive performance, and biological pathways implicating brain development and abnormal apoptosis (mean [SD] β, 0.83 [0.02]; P = 4.22 × 10-6). This cross-sectional study discovered 3-dimensional endophenotypic representation that may elucidate the heterogeneous neurobiological underpinnings of ASD to support precision diagnostics. The significant correspondence between A2 and schizophrenia indicates a possibility of identifying common biological mechanisms across the 2 mental health diagnoses."
Brain Age Is Not a Significant Predictor of Relapse Risk in Late-Life Depression.,39349179,Carmen Andreescu,University of Pittsburgh,Department of Psychiatry,"Late-life depression (LLD) has been associated cross-sectionally with lower brain structural volumes and accelerated brain aging compared with healthy control participants (HCs). There are few longitudinal studies on the neurobiological predictors of recurrence in LLD. We tested a machine learning brain age model and its prospective association with LLD recurrence risk. We recruited individuals with LLD (n = 102) and HCs (n = 43) into a multisite, 2-year longitudinal study. Individuals with LLD were enrolled within 4 months of remission. Remitted participants with LLD underwent baseline neuroimaging and longitudinal clinical follow-up. Over 2 years, 43 participants with LLD relapsed and 59 stayed in remission. We used a previously developed machine learning brain age algorithm to compute brain age at baseline, and we evaluated brain age group differences (HC vs. LLD and HC vs. remitted LLD vs. relapsed LLD). We conducted a Cox proportional hazards model to evaluate whether baseline brain age predicted time to relapse. We found that brain age did not significantly differ between the HC and LLD groups or between the HC, remitted LLD, and relapsed LLD groups. Brain age did not significantly predict time to relapse. In contrast to our hypothesis, we found that brain age did not differ between control participants without depression and individuals with remitted LLD, and brain age was not associated with subsequent recurrence. This is in contrast to existing literature which has identified baseline brain age differences in late life but consistent with work that has shown no differences between people who do and do not relapse on gross structural measures."
Voxelwise Multivariate Analysis of Brain-Psychosocial Associations in Adolescents Reveals 6 Latent Dimensions of Cognition and Psychopathology.,38588854,Janaina Mourão-Miranda,University College London,Department of Computer Science,"Adolescence heralds the onset of considerable psychopathology, which may be conceptualized as an emergence of altered covariation between symptoms and brain measures. Multivariate methods can detect such modes of covariation or latent dimensions, but none specifically relating to psychopathology have yet been found using population-level structural brain data. Using voxelwise (instead of parcellated) brain data may strengthen latent dimensions' brain-psychosocial relationships, but this creates computational challenges. We obtained voxelwise gray matter density and psychosocial variables from the baseline (ages 9-10 years) Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study cohort (N = 11,288) and employed a state-of-the-art segmentation method, sparse partial least squares, and a rigorous machine learning framework to prevent overfitting. We found 6 latent dimensions, 4 of which pertain specifically to mental health. The mental health dimensions were related to overeating, anorexia/internalizing, oppositional symptoms (all ps < .002) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms (p = .03). Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was related to increased and internalizing symptoms related to decreased gray matter density in dopaminergic and serotonergic midbrain areas, whereas oppositional symptoms were related to increased gray matter in a noradrenergic nucleus. Internalizing symptoms were related to increased and oppositional symptoms to reduced gray matter density in the insular, cingulate, and auditory cortices. Striatal regions featured strongly, with reduced caudate nucleus gray matter in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and reduced putamen gray matter in oppositional/conduct problems. Voxelwise gray matter density generated stronger brain-psychosocial correlations than brain parcellations. Voxelwise brain data strengthen latent dimensions of brain-psychosocial covariation, and sparse multivariate methods increase their psychopathological specificity. Internalizing and externalizing symptoms are associated with opposite gray matter changes in similar cortical and subcortical areas."
An arginine-rich nuclear localization signal (ArgiNLS) strategy for streamlined image segmentation of single cells.,39074275,Sam A Golden,University of Washington,Center of Excellence in Neurobiology of Addiction,"High-throughput volumetric fluorescent microscopy pipelines can spatially integrate whole-brain structure and function at the foundational level of single cells. However, conventional fluorescent protein (FP) modifications used to discriminate single cells possess limited efficacy or are detrimental to cellular health. Here, we introduce a synthetic and nondeleterious nuclear localization signal (NLS) tag strategy, called ""Arginine-rich NLS"" (ArgiNLS), that optimizes genetic labeling and downstream image segmentation of single cells by restricting FP localization near-exclusively in the nucleus through a poly-arginine mechanism. A single N-terminal ArgiNLS tag provides modular nuclear restriction consistently across spectrally separate FP variants. ArgiNLS performance in vivo displays functional conservation across major cortical cell classes and in response to both local and systemic brain-wide AAV administration. Crucially, the high signal-to-noise ratio afforded by ArgiNLS enhances machine learning-automated segmentation of single cells due to rapid classifier training and enrichment of labeled cell detection within 2D brain sections or 3D volumetric whole-brain image datasets, derived from both staining-amplified and native signal. This genetic strategy provides a simple and flexible basis for precise image segmentation of genetically labeled single cells at scale and paired with behavioral procedures."
"The functional neurobiology of negative affective traits across regions, networks, signatures, and a machine learning multiverse.",40475558,T D Wager,Dartmouth College,N/A,"Understanding the neural basis of negative affective traits like neuroticism remains a critical challenge across psychology, neuroscience, and psychiatry. Here, we investigate which level of brain organization-regions, networks, or validated whole-brain machine-learning signatures-best explains negative affective traits in a community sample of 458 adults performing the two most widely used affective fMRI tasks, viewing emotional faces and scenes. Neuroticism could not be predicted from brain activity, with Bayesian evidence against all theory-guided neural measures. However, preregistered whole-brain models successfully decoded vulnerability to stress, a lower-level facet of neuroticism, with results replicating in a hold-out sample. The neural stress vulnerability pattern demonstrated good psychometric properties and indicated that negative affective traits are best represented by distributed whole-brain patterns related to domain-general stimulation rather than localized activity. Together with results from a comprehensive multiverse analysis across 14 traits and 1,176 models-available for exploration in an online app-the findings speak against simplistic neurobiological theories of negative affective traits, highlight a striking gap between predicting individual differences (<i>r</i><.35) and within-person emotional states (<i>r</i>=.88), and underscore the importance of aligning psychological constructs with neural measures at the appropriate level of granularity."
Mechanisms underlying capsulotomy for refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder: neural correlates of negative affect processing overlap with deep brain stimulation targets.,36878966,Valerie Voon,University of Cambridge,Department of Psychiatry,"Ablative procedures such as anterior capsulotomy are potentially effective in refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Converging evidence suggests the ventral internal capsule white matter tracts traversing the rostral cingulate and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and thalamus is the optimal target for clinical efficacy across multiple deep brain stimulation targets for OCD. Here we ask which prefrontal regions and underlying cognitive processes might be implicated in the effects of capsulotomy by using both task fMRI and neuropsychological tests assessing OCD-relevant cognitive mechanisms known to map across prefrontal regions connected to the tracts targeted in capsulotomy. We tested OCD patients at least 6 months post-capsulotomy (n = 27), OCD controls (n = 33) and healthy controls (n = 34). We used a modified aversive monetary incentive delay paradigm with negative imagery and a within session extinction trial. Post-capsulotomy OCD subjects showed improved OCD symptoms, disability and quality of life with no differences in mood or anxiety or cognitive task performance on executive, inhibition, memory and learning tasks. Task fMRI revealed post-capsulotomy decreases in the nucleus accumbens during negative anticipation, and in the left rostral cingulate and left inferior frontal cortex during negative feedback. Post-capsulotomy patients showed attenuated accumbens-rostral cingulate functional connectivity. Rostral cingulate activity mediated capsulotomy improvement on obsessions. These regions overlap with optimal white matter tracts observed across multiple stimulation targets for OCD and might provide insights into further optimizing neuromodulation approaches. Our findings also suggest that aversive processing theoretical mechanisms may link ablative, stimulation and psychological interventions."
Artificial Intelligence in Value-Based Health Care.,40454290,Prakash Jayakumar,The University of Texas at Austin,Department of Surgery and Perioperative Care,"Artificial intelligence (AI) presents new opportunities to advance value-based healthcare in orthopedic surgery through 3 potential mechanisms: agency, automation, and augmentation. AI may enhance patient agency through improved health literacy and remote monitoring while reducing costs through triage and reduction in specialist visits. In automation, AI optimizes operating room scheduling and streamlines administrative tasks, with documented cost savings and improved efficiency. For augmentation, AI has been shown to be accurate in diagnostic imaging interpretation and surgical planning, while enabling more precise outcome predictions and personalized treatment approaches. However, implementation faces substantial challenges, including resistance from healthcare professionals, technical barriers to data quality and privacy, and significant financial investments required for infrastructure. Success in healthcare AI integration requires careful attention to regulatory frameworks, data privacy, and clinical validation."
Multiband EEG signature decoded using machine learning for predicting rTMS treatment response in major depression.,39399007,Yu Zhang,Lehigh University,Department of Bioengineering,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a global health challenge with high prevalence. Further, many diagnosed with MDD are treatment resistant to traditional antidepressants. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) offers promise as an alternative solution, but identifying objective biomarkers for predicting treatment response remains underexplored. Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings are a cost-effective neuroimaging approach, but traditional EEG analysis methods often do not consider patient-specific variations and fail to capture complex neuronal dynamics. To address this, we propose a data-driven approach combining iterated masking empirical mode decomposition (itEMD) and sparse Bayesian learning (SBL). Our results demonstrated significant prediction of rTMS outcomes using this approach (Protocol 1: r=0.40, p<0.01; Protocol 2: r=0.26, p<0.05). From the decomposition, we obtained three key oscillations: IMF-Alpha, IMF-Beta, and the remaining residue. We also identified key spatial patterns associated with treatment outcomes for two rTMS protocols: for Protocol 1 (10Hz left DLPFC), important areas include the left frontal and parietal regions, while for Protocol 2 (1Hz right DLPFC), the left and frontal, left parietal regions are crucial. Additionally, our exploratory analysis found few significant correlations between oscillation specific predictive features and personality measures. This study highlights the potential of machine learning-driven EEG analysis for personalized MDD treatment prediction, offering a pathway for improved patient outcomes."
InterpolAI: deep learning-based optical flow interpolation and restoration of biomedical images for improved 3D tissue mapping.,40437217,Denis Wirtz,Johns Hopkins University,Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering,"Recent advances in imaging and computation have enabled analysis of large three-dimensional (3D) biological datasets, revealing spatial composition, morphology, cellular interactions and rare events. However, the accuracy of these analyses is limited by image quality, which can be compromised by missing data, tissue damage or low resolution due to mechanical, temporal or financial constraints. Here, we introduce InterpolAI, a method for interpolation of synthetic images between pairs of authentic images in a stack of images, by leveraging frame interpolation for large image motion, an optical flow-based artificial intelligence (AI) model. InterpolAI outperforms both linear interpolation and state-of-the-art optical flow-based method XVFI, preserving microanatomical features and cell counts, and image contrast, variance and luminance. InterpolAI repairs tissue damages and reduces stitching artifacts. We validated InterpolAI across multiple imaging modalities, species, staining techniques and pixel resolutions. This work demonstrates the potential of AI in improving the resolution, throughput and quality of image datasets to enable improved 3D imaging."
Opportunities for Artificial Intelligence in Operational Medicine: Lessons from the United States Military.,40428137,Vincent B Ho,Uniformed Services University for Health Science,Department of Radiology and Bioengineering,"Conducted in challenging environments such as disaster or conflict areas, operational medicine presents unique challenges for the delivery of efficient and quality healthcare. It exposes first responders and medical personnel to many unexpected health risks and dangerous situations. To tackle these issues, artificial intelligence (AI) has been progressively incorporated into operational medicine, both on the front lines and also more recently in support roles. The ability of AI to rapidly analyze high-dimensional data and make inferences has opened up a wide variety of opportunities and increased efficiency for its early adopters, notably for the United States military, for non-invasive medical imaging and for mental health applications. This review discusses the current state of AI and highlights its broad array of potential applications in operational medicine as developed for the United States military."
"Cortical myelin mapping in antipsychotic medication-naïve, first-episode psychosis patients.",40410588,Nina V Kraguljac,University of Alabama at Birmingham,Department of Psychology,"While white matter myelin primarily functions to accelerate conduction velocity and has been extensively studied in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (SSD), less is known about the role of gray matter myelin in SSD. Cortical myelination occurs mostly on the proximal axons of parvalbumin positive (PV+) interneurons, where it assists in trophic support and experience-dependent plasticity. Given the role of PV+ interneuron dysfunction in SSD, it is critical to advance our understanding of cortical myelin pathology in this context. Here, we quantified myelin maps using the T1w/T2w ratio in a large group of antipsychotic medication-naïve, first-episode psychosis patients. We compared myelin content between patients (N = 91) and controls (N = 107) using a MANCOVA and calculated zero-order correlations with the discriminant function for each region, then used a machine learning approach to identify the most parsimonious constellation of cortical regions driving group differences using a stepwise algorithm. Group membership was significantly associated with T1w/T2w ratio (Wilks Lambda = 0.09, p < 0.01), where patients had higher myelin values compared to healthy controls. We identified a subset of 16 regions, primarily located in association cortices, that were sufficient to explain group differences. Here, we report an increase in the cortical T1w/T2w ratio in association cortices in first-episode psychosis. We suggest that faulty myelin compaction during this critical developmental period could contribute to PV+ interneuron pathology and cortical microcircuit disruptions resulting in the clinical phenotype. With additional empirical support from future studies, novel treatment strategies targeting cortical myelin could have potential to mitigate circuit dysfunction in the illness."
Association Between Risk Factors and Major Cancers: Explainable Machine Learning Approach.,40315870,Yun Jiang,University of Michigan-Ann Arbor,School of Nursing,"Cancer is a life-threatening disease and a leading cause of death worldwide, with an estimated 611,000 deaths and over 2 million new cases in the United States in 2024. The rising incidence of major cancers, including among younger individuals, highlights the need for early screening and monitoring of risk factors to manage and decrease cancer risk. This study aimed to leverage explainable machine learning models to identify and analyze the key risk factors associated with breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancers. By uncovering significant associations between risk factors and these major cancer types, we sought to enhance the understanding of cancer diagnosis risk profiles. Our goal was to facilitate more precise screening, early detection, and personalized prevention strategies, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes and promoting health equity. Deidentified electronic health record data from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III was used to identify patients with 4 types of cancer who had longitudinal hospital visits prior to their diagnosis presence. Their records were matched and combined with those of patients without cancer diagnoses using propensity scores based on demographic factors. Three advanced models, penalized logistic regression, random forest, and multilayer perceptron (MLP), were conducted to identify the rank of risk factors for each cancer type, with feature importance analysis for random forest and MLP models. The rank biased overlap was adopted to compare the similarity of ranked risk factors across cancer types. Our framework evaluated the prediction performance of explainable machine learning models, with the MLP model demonstrating the best performance. It achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.78 for breast cancer (n=58), 0.76 for colorectal cancer (n=140), 0.84 for lung cancer (n=398), and 0.78 for prostate cancer (n=104), outperforming other baseline models (P<.001). In addition to demographic risk factors, the most prominent nontraditional risk factors overlapped across models and cancer types, including hyperlipidemia (odds ratio [OR] 1.14, 95% CI 1.11-1.17; P<.01), diabetes (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.29-1.39; P<.01), depressive disorders (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06-1.16; P<.01), heart diseases (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.32-1.52; P<.01), and anemia (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.14-1.30; P<.01). The similarity analysis indicated the unique risk factor pattern for lung cancer from other cancer types. The study's findings demonstrated the effectiveness of explainable ML models in assessing nontraditional risk factors for major cancers and highlighted the importance of considering unique risk profiles for different cancer types. Moreover, this research served as a hypothesis-generating foundation, providing preliminary results for future investigation into cancer diagnosis risk analysis and management. Furthermore, expanding collaboration with clinical experts for external validation would be essential to refine model outputs, integrate findings into practice, and enhance their impact on patient care and cancer prevention efforts."
Machine learning approaches for fine-grained symptom estimation in schizophrenia: A comprehensive review.,40305920,Ioannis Patras,Queen Mary University of London,N/A,"Schizophrenia is a severe yet treatable mental disorder, and it is diagnosed using a multitude of primary and secondary symptoms. Diagnosis and treatment for each individual depends on the severity of the symptoms. Therefore, there is a need for accurate, personalised assessments. However, the process can be both time-consuming and subjective; hence, there is a motivation to explore automated methods that can offer consistent diagnosis and precise symptom assessments, thereby complementing the work of healthcare practitioners. Machine Learning has demonstrated impressive capabilities across numerous domains, including medicine; the use of Machine Learning in patient assessment holds great promise for healthcare professionals and patients alike, as it can lead to more consistent and accurate symptom estimation. This survey reviews methodologies utilising Machine Learning for diagnosing and assessing schizophrenia. Contrary to previous reviews that primarily focused on binary classification, this work recognises the complexity of the condition and, instead, offers an overview of Machine Learning methods designed for fine-grained symptom estimation. We cover multiple modalities, namely Medical Imaging, Electroencephalograms and Audio-Visual, as the illness symptoms can manifest in a patient's pathology and behaviour. Finally, we analyse the datasets and methodologies used in the studies and identify trends, gaps, as opportunities for future research."
Myo-Guide: A Machine Learning-Based Web Application for Neuromuscular Disease Diagnosis With MRI.,40275674,Jordi Díaz-Manera,Newcastle University,N/A,"Neuromuscular diseases (NMDs) are rare disorders characterized by progressive muscle fibre loss, leading to replacement by fibrotic and fatty tissue, muscle weakness and disability. Early diagnosis is critical for therapeutic decisions, care planning and genetic counselling. Muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as a valuable diagnostic tool by identifying characteristic patterns of muscle involvement. However, the increasing complexity of these patterns complicates their interpretation, limiting their clinical utility. Additionally, multi-study data aggregation introduces heterogeneity challenges. This study presents a novel multi-study harmonization pipeline for muscle MRI and an AI-driven diagnostic tool to assist clinicians in identifying disease-specific muscle involvement patterns. We developed a preprocessing pipeline to standardize MRI fat content across datasets, minimizing source bias. An ensemble of XGBoost models was trained to classify patients based on intramuscular fat replacement, age at MRI and sex. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework was adapted to analyse model predictions and identify disease-specific muscle involvement patterns. To address class imbalance, training and evaluation were conducted using class-balanced metrics. The model's performance was compared against four expert clinicians using 14 previously unseen MRI scans. Using our harmonization approach, we curated a dataset of 2961 MRI samples from genetically confirmed cases of 20 paediatric and adult NMDs. The model achieved a balanced accuracy of 64.8% ± 3.4%, with a weighted top-3 accuracy of 84.7% ± 1.8% and top-5 accuracy of 90.2% ± 2.4%. It also identified key features relevant for differential diagnosis, aiding clinical decision-making. Compared to four expert clinicians, the model obtained the highest top-3 accuracy (75.0% ± 4.8%). The diagnostic tool has been implemented as a free web platform, providing global access to the medical community. The application of AI in muscle MRI for NMD diagnosis remains underexplored due to data scarcity. This study introduces a framework for dataset harmonization, enabling advanced computational techniques. Our findings demonstrate the potential of AI-based approaches to enhance differential diagnosis by identifying disease-specific muscle involvement patterns. The developed tool surpasses expert performance in diagnostic ranking and is accessible to clinicians worldwide via the Myo-Guide online platform."
Transfer Learning of Deep Neural Networks Pretrained Using the ABCD Dataset for General Psychopathology Prediction in Korean Adolescents.,40268244,Jong-Hwan Lee,Korea University,Department of Brain and Cognitive Engineering,"In this study, we examined whether a deep neural network (DNN), trained to predict the general psychopathology factor (p factor) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from adolescents in the ABCD (Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development) Study, would generalize to Korean adolescents. We trained a scanner-generalization neural network (SGNN) to predict p factor scores from resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) data of 6905 ABCD Study adolescents, controlling for MRI scanner-related confounds. Then, we transferred the pretrained SGNN to a DNN to predict p factor scores for 125 adolescents, including healthy individuals and individuals with major depressive disorder, using data from Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH). We compared the transferred DNN's performance with that of kernel ridge regression (KRR) and a baseline DNN. The transferred DNN outperformed KRR (0.17 ± 0.16; 0.60 ± 0.07) and the baseline DNN (0.17 ± 0.16; 0.69 ± 0.11), with a higher Pearson's correlation coefficient (0.29 ± 0.18) and lower mean absolute error (0.59 ± 0.09; p < .005). We identified the default mode network (DMN) and visual network (VIS) as crucial functional networks for predicting p factors across both datasets. The dorsal attention network was specific to the ABCD Study dataset, while the cingulo-opercular and ventral attention networks were specific to the SNUH dataset. The transferred SGNN successfully generalized to Korean adolescents. Altered RSFC in the DMN and VIS may serve as promising biomarkers for p factor prediction across diverse populations, addressing heterogeneity in demographics, diagnoses, and MRI scanner characteristics."
Seeing beyond the symptoms: biomarkers and brain regions linked to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.,38813532,Abbas Babajani-Feremi,University of Florida,Department of Neurology,"Early Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis remains challenging, necessitating specific biomarkers for timely detection. This study aimed to identify such biomarkers and explore their associations with cognitive decline. A cohort of 1759 individuals across cognitive aging stages, including healthy controls (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD, was examined. Utilizing nine biomarkers from structural MRI (sMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and positron emission tomography (PET), predictions were made for Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDRSB), and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS). Biomarkers included four sMRI (e.g., average thickness [ATH]), four DTI (e.g., mean diffusivity [MD]), and one PET Amyloid-β (Aβ) measure. Ensemble regression tree (ERT) technique with bagging and random forest approaches were applied in four groups (HC/MCI, HC/AD, MCI/AD, and HC/MCI/AD). Aβ emerged as a robust predictor of cognitive scores, particularly in late-stage AD. Volumetric measures, notably ATH, consistently correlated with cognitive scores across early and late disease stages. Additionally, ADAS demonstrated links to various neuroimaging biomarkers in all subject groups, highlighting its efficacy in monitoring brain changes throughout disease progression. ERT identified key brain regions associated with cognitive scores, such as the right transverse temporal region for Aβ, left and right entorhinal cortex, left inferior temporal gyrus, and left middle temporal gyrus for ATH, and the left uncinate fasciculus for MD. This study underscores the importance of an interdisciplinary approach in understanding AD mechanisms, offering potential contributions to early biomarker development."
"A multi-site, multi-modal travelling-heads resource for brain MRI harmonisation.",40216796,Stamatios N Sotiropoulos,University of Nottingham,School of Medicine,"Despite its great potential for studying the living brain, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be often limited by nuisance non-biological factors, such as hardware/software differences between scanners, which can interfere with biological variability. This lack of standardisation or harmonisation between scanners hinders reproducibility and quantifiability of MRI. Towards addressing this challenge, we present one of the most comprehensive MRI harmonisation resources, based on a travelling heads paradigm; healthy volunteers scanned repeatedly across different scanners. The Oxford-Nottingham Harmonisation (ON-Harmony) resource offers data from 20 participants each scanned on six different 3 T MRI scanners from three major vendors (GE/Philips/Siemens) across five imaging sites. Each scanning session includes five imaging modalities (T1w/T2w/dMRI/rfMRI/SWI) with protocols aligned to the UK Biobank, while for about half of the participants five within-scanner repeats are additionally acquired. The 165 multi-modal scanning sessions allow mapping of different pools of variability (biological, between-scanner, within-scanner) for hundreds of MRI-derived measures. We describe the breadth of information contained in the publicly-available data and showcase their reuse potential for evaluating efficacy of harmonisation approaches."
"""Precision Medicine"" and the Failed Search for Binary Brain Sex Differences to Address Gender Behavioral Health Disparities.",40207611,Lise Eliot,Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine & Science,Chicago Medical School,"Human brain imaging took off in the 1980s and has since flooded the zone in the analysis of gender differences in behavior and mental health. Couched in the aims of ""precision medicine,"" the vast majority of this research has taken a binary approach, dividing participants according to the M/F box at intake and asserting that the sex differences found in neuroimaging will lead to important advances for treating neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the actual findings from this 40-year project have not lived up to its promise, in part because of the over-binarization of sex and general ignorance of gender as a complex variable influencing human behavior and brain function. This paper reviews the history of failed claims about male-female brain difference in the modern era, illuminates the deep-pocketed incentives driving such research, and examines the limitations of this binary approach for understanding gender-related behavior and health disparities. It then considers more recent efforts to ""break the binary"" by using measures of ""gender"" in addition to ""sex"" as an independent variable in brain imaging studies. Given the multidimensional nature of gender-as identity, expression, roles and relations-this is challenging to implement, with initial efforts producing little of substance. Better approaches to addressing male-female disparities in brain health will require focusing on specific behaviors (e.g., anxiety, risk-taking, verbal memory, spatial navigation) and specific components of sex and gender (e.g., body size, hormone levels, gene expression, caregiver role, financial independence, discrimination) when seeking brain-behavior correlates in a diverse population."
Linking Symptom Inventories Using Semantic Textual Similarity.,40200899,Emily L Dennis,University of Utah School of Medicine,Department of Neurology,"An extensive library of symptom inventories has been developed over time to measure clinical symptoms of traumatic brain injury (TBI), but this variety has led to several long-standing issues. Most notably, results drawn from different settings and studies are not comparable. This creates a fundamental problem in TBI diagnostics and outcome prediction, namely that it is not possible to equate results drawn from distinct tools and symptom inventories. Here, we present an approach using semantic textual similarity (STS) to link symptoms and scores across previously incongruous symptom inventories by ranking item text similarities according to their conceptual likeness. We tested the ability of four pretrained deep learning models to screen thousands of symptom description pairs for related content-a challenging task typically requiring expert panels. Models were tasked to predict symptom severity across four different inventories for 6,607 participants drawn from 16 international data sources. The STS approach achieved 74.8% accuracy across five tasks, outperforming other models tested. Correlation and factor analysis found the properties of the scales were broadly preserved under conversion. This work suggests that incorporating contextual, semantic information can assist expert decision-making processes, yielding broad gains for the harmonization of TBI assessment."
Examining factors related to low performance of predicting remission in participants with major depressive disorder using neuroimaging data and other clinical features.,38547128,Jie Yang,Stony Brook University,Department of Family,"Major depressive disorder (MDD), a prevalent mental health issue, affects more than 8% of the US population, and almost 17% in the young group of 18-25 years old. Since Covid-19, its prevalence has become even more significant. However, the remission (being free of depression) rates of first-line antidepressant treatments on MDD are only about 30%. To improve treatment outcomes, researchers have built various predictive models for treatment responses and yet none of them have been adopted in clinical use. One reason is that most predictive models are based on data from subjective questionnaires, which are less reliable. Neuroimaging data are promising objective prognostic factors, but they are expensive to obtain and hence predictive models using neuroimaging data are limited and such studies were usually in small scale (N<100). In this paper, we proposed an advanced machine learning (ML) pipeline for small training dataset with large number of features. We implemented multiple imputation for missing data and repeated K-fold cross validation (CV) to robustly estimate predictive performances. Different feature selection methods and stacking methods using 6 general ML models including random forest, gradient boosting decision tree, XGBoost, penalized logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), and neural network were examined to evaluate the model performances. All predictive models were compared using model performance metrics such as accuracy, balanced accuracy, area under ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity. Our proposed ML pipeline was applied to a training dataset and obtained an accuracy and AUC above 0.80. But such high performance failed while applying our ML pipeline using an external validation dataset from the EMBARC study which is a multi-center study. We further examined the possible reasons especially the site heterogeneity issue."
Smaller cornu ammonis (CA3) as a potential risk factor for suicidal behavior in mood disorders.,37244064,J John Mann,New York State Psychiatric Institute,N/A,"Mood disorders and suicidal behavior have moderate heritability and familial transmission, and are associated with smaller hippocampal volumes. However, it is unclear whether hippocampal alterations reflect heritable risk or epigenetic effects of childhood adversity, compensatory mechanisms, illness-related changes, or treatment effects. We sought to separate the relationships of hippocampal substructure volumes to mood disorder, suicidal behavior, and risk and resilience to both by examining high familial risk individuals (HR) who have passed the age of greatest risk for psychopathology onset. Structural brain imaging and hippocampal substructure segmentation quantified Cornu Ammonis (CA1-4), dentate gyrus, and subiculum gray matter volumes in healthy volunteers (HV, N = 25) and three groups with one or more relatives reporting early-onset mood disorder and suicide attempt: 1. Unaffected HR (N = 20); 2. HR with lifetime mood disorder and no suicide attempt (HR-MOOD, N = 25); and 3. HR with lifetime mood disorder and a previous suicide attempt (HR-MOOD + SA, N = 18). Findings were tested in an independent cohort not selected for family history (HV, N = 47; MOOD, N = 44; and MOOD + SA, N = 21). Lower CA3 volume was found in HR (vs. HV), consistent with the direction of previously published findings in MOOD+SA (vs. HV and MOOD), suggesting the finding reflects a familial biological risk marker, not illness or treatment-related sequelae, of suicidal behavior and mood disorder. Familial suicide risk may be mediated in part by smaller CA3 volume. The structure may serve as a risk indicator and therapeutic target for suicide prevention strategies in high-risk families."
A tale of two lexica: Investigating computational pressures on word representation with neural networks.,37051161,David W Gow,Massachusetts General Hospital,Department of Neurology,"The notion of a single localized store of word representations has become increasingly less plausible as evidence has accumulated for the widely distributed neural representation of wordform grounded in motor, perceptual, and conceptual processes. Here, we attempt to combine machine learning methods and neurobiological frameworks to propose a computational model of brain systems potentially responsible for wordform representation. We tested the hypothesis that the functional specialization of word representation in the brain is driven partly by computational optimization. This hypothesis directly addresses the unique problem of mapping sound and articulation vs. mapping sound and meaning. We found that artificial neural networks trained on the mapping between sound and articulation performed poorly in recognizing the mapping between sound and meaning and vice versa. Moreover, a network trained on both tasks simultaneously could not discover the features required for efficient mapping between sound and higher-level cognitive states compared to the other two models. Furthermore, these networks developed internal representations reflecting specialized task-optimized functions without explicit training. Together, these findings demonstrate that different task-directed representations lead to more focused responses and better performance of a machine or algorithm and, hypothetically, the brain. Thus, we imply that the functional specialization of word representation mirrors a computational optimization strategy given the nature of the tasks that the human brain faces."
Evaluating the safety profile of connectome-based repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.,40116602,Jacky Yeung,Yale University School of Medicine PO Box,Department of Neurosurgery,"New developments in neuro-navigation and machine learning have allowed for personalised approaches to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to treat various neuropsychiatric disorders. One specific approach, known as the cingulum framework, identifies individualised brain parcellations from resting state fMRI based on a machine-learning algorithm. Theta burst stimulation, a more rapid form of rTMS, is then delivered for 25 sessions, 5 per day, over 5 days consecutively or spaced out over 10 days. Preliminary studies have documented this approach for various neurological and psychiatric ailments. However, the safety and tolerability of this approach are unclear. We performed a retrospective study on 165 unique patients (202 target sets) treated with this personalised approach between January 2020 and December 2023. Common side effects included fatigue (102/202, 50%), local muscle twitching (89/202, 43%), headaches (49/202, 23%), and discomfort (31/202, 17%), all transient. The top 10 unique parcellations commonly found in the target sets included L8av (52%), LPGs (28%), LTe1m (21%), RTe1m (18%), LPFM (17%), Ls6-8 (13%), Rs6-8 (9%), L46 (7%), L1 (6%), and L6v (6%). Fatigue was most common in target sets that contained R6v (6/6, 100%) and L8c (5/5, 100%). Muscle twitches were most common in target sets that contained RTGv (5/5, 100%) and LTGv (4/4, 100%). These side effects were all transient and well-tolerated. No serious side effects were recorded. Results suggested that individualised, connectome-guided rTMS is safe and contain side-effect profiles similar to other TMS approaches reported in the literature."
Assessment of Neuroanatomical Endophenotypes of Autism Spectrum Disorder and Association With Characteristics of Individuals With Schizophrenia and the General Population.,37017948,Christos Davatzikos,University of Pennsylvania,AI 2 D Center for Data Science for Integrated Diagnostics,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with significant clinical, neuroanatomical, and genetic heterogeneity that limits precision diagnostics and treatment. To assess distinct neuroanatomical dimensions of ASD using novel semisupervised machine learning methods and to test whether the dimensions can serve as endophenotypes also in non-ASD populations. This cross-sectional study used imaging data from the publicly available Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) repositories as the discovery cohort. The ABIDE sample included individuals diagnosed with ASD aged between 16 and 64 years and age- and sex-match typically developing individuals. Validation cohorts included individuals with schizophrenia from the Psychosis Heterogeneity Evaluated via Dimensional Neuroimaging (PHENOM) consortium and individuals from the UK Biobank to represent the general population. The multisite discovery cohort included 16 internationally distributed imaging sites. Analyses were performed between March 2021 and March 2022. The trained semisupervised heterogeneity through discriminative analysis models were tested for reproducibility using extensive cross-validations. It was then applied to individuals from the PHENOM and the UK Biobank. It was hypothesized that neuroanatomical dimensions of ASD would display distinct clinical and genetic profiles and would be prominent also in non-ASD populations. Heterogeneity through discriminative analysis models trained on T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance images of 307 individuals with ASD (mean [SD] age, 25.4 [9.8] years; 273 [88.9%] male) and 362 typically developing control individuals (mean [SD] age, 25.8 [8.9] years; 309 [85.4%] male) revealed that a 3-dimensional scheme was optimal to capture the ASD neuroanatomy. The first dimension (A1: aginglike) was associated with smaller brain volume, lower cognitive function, and aging-related genetic variants (FOXO3; Z = 4.65; P = 1.62 × 10-6). The second dimension (A2: schizophrenialike) was characterized by enlarged subcortical volumes, antipsychotic medication use (Cohen d = 0.65; false discovery rate-adjusted P = .048), partially overlapping genetic, neuroanatomical characteristics to schizophrenia (n = 307), and significant genetic heritability estimates in the general population (n = 14 786; mean [SD] h2, 0.71 [0.04]; P < 1 × 10-4). The third dimension (A3: typical ASD) was distinguished by enlarged cortical volumes, high nonverbal cognitive performance, and biological pathways implicating brain development and abnormal apoptosis (mean [SD] β, 0.83 [0.02]; P = 4.22 × 10-6). This cross-sectional study discovered 3-dimensional endophenotypic representation that may elucidate the heterogeneous neurobiological underpinnings of ASD to support precision diagnostics. The significant correspondence between A2 and schizophrenia indicates a possibility of identifying common biological mechanisms across the 2 mental health diagnoses."
Causal factors in childhood and adolescence leading to anabolic-androgenic steroid use: A machine learning approach.,38304122,Harrison G Pope,McLean Hospital,Biological Psychiatry Laboratory and Psychiatric Epidemiology Research Program,"Prior research has demonstrated associations between anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) use and features from several childhood and adolescent psychosocial domains including body image concerns, antisocial traits, and low levels of parental care. However, prior approaches have been limited by their focus on individual features and lack of consideration of the relevant causal structure. We re-analyzed data from a previous cross-sectional cohort study of 232 male weightlifters aged 18-40, of whom 101 had used AAS. These men completed retrospective measures of features from their childhood and early adolescence, including body image concerns, eating disorder psychopathology, antisocial traits, substance use, and family relationships. Using an approach informed by principles of causal inference, we applied four machine-learning methods - lasso regression, elastic net regression, random forests, and gradient boosting - to predict AAS use. The four methods yielded similar receiver operating curves, mean area under the curve (range 0.66 to 0.72), and sets of highly important features. Features related to adolescent body image concerns (especially muscle dysmorphia symptoms) were the strongest predictors. Other important features were adolescent rebellious behaviors; adolescent feelings of ineffectiveness and lack of interoceptive awareness; and low levels of paternal care. Applying machine learning within a causally informed approach to re-analyze data from a prior study of weightlifters, we identified six factors (most prominently those related to adolescent body image concerns) as proposed causal factors for the development of AAS use. Compared with the prior analyses, this approach achieved greater methodologic rigor and yielded stronger and broader findings."
Automated detection of cerebral microbleeds on MR images using knowledge distillation framework.,37492242,Mark Jenkinson,University of Oxford,Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences,"Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are associated with white matter damage, and various neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases. CMBs occur as small, circular hypointense lesions on T2*-weighted gradient recalled echo (GRE) and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) images, and hyperintense on quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) images due to their paramagnetic nature. Accurate automated detection of CMBs would help to determine quantitative imaging biomarkers (e.g., CMB count) on large datasets. In this work, we propose a fully automated, deep learning-based, 3-step algorithm, using structural and anatomical properties of CMBs from any single input image modality (e.g., GRE/SWI/QSM) for their accurate detections. In our method, the first step consists of an initial candidate detection step that detects CMBs with high sensitivity. In the second step, candidate discrimination step is performed using a knowledge distillation framework, with a multi-tasking teacher network that guides the student network to classify CMB and non-CMB instances in an offline manner. Finally, a morphological clean-up step further reduces false positives using anatomical constraints. We used four datasets consisting of different modalities specified above, acquired using various protocols and with a variety of pathological and demographic characteristics. On cross-validation within datasets, our method achieved a cluster-wise true positive rate (TPR) of over 90% with an average of <2 false positives per subject. The knowledge distillation framework improves the cluster-wise TPR of the student model by 15%. Our method is flexible in terms of the input modality and provides comparable cluster-wise TPR and better cluster-wise precision compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. When evaluating across different datasets, our method showed good generalizability with a cluster-wise TPR >80 % with different modalities. The python implementation of the proposed method is openly available."
Centrality nearest-neighbor projected-distance regression (C-NPDR) feature selection for correlation-based predictors with application to resting-state fMRI study of major depressive disorder.,40048476,B A McKinney,The University of Tulsa,Tandy School of Computer Science,"Nearest-neighbor projected-distance regression (NPDR) is a metric-based machine learning feature selection algorithm that uses distances between samples and projected differences between variables to identify variables or features that may interact to affect the prediction of complex outcomes. Typical tabular bioinformatics data consist of separate variables of interest, such as genes or proteins. In contrast, resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data are composed of time-series for brain regions of interest (ROIs) for each subject, and these within-brain time-series are typically transformed into correlations between pairs of ROIs. These pairs of variables of interest can then be used as inputs for feature selection or other machine learning methods. Straightforward feature selection would return the most significant pairs of ROIs; however, it would also be beneficial to know the importance of individual ROIs. We extend NPDR to compute the importance of individual ROIs from correlation-based features. We introduce correlation-difference and centrality-based versions of NPDR. Centrality-based NPDR can be coupled with any centrality method and can be coupled with importance scores other than NPDR, such as random forest importance scores. We develop a new simulation method using random network theory to generate artificial correlation data predictors with variations in correlations that affect class prediction. We compared feature selection methods based on detection of functional simulated ROIs, and we applied the new centrality NPDR approach to a resting-state fMRI study of major depressive disorder (MDD) participants and healthy controls. We determined that the areas of the brain that have the strongest network effect on MDD include the middle temporal gyrus, the inferior temporal gyrus, and the dorsal entorhinal cortex. The resulting feature selection and simulation approaches can be applied to other domains that use correlation-based features."
Addressing multi-site functional MRI heterogeneity through dual-expert collaborative learning for brain disease identification.,37227019,Mingxia Liu,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,Department of Radiology and BRIC,"Several studies employ multi-site rs-fMRI data for major depressive disorder (MDD) identification, with a specific site as the to-be-analyzed target domain and other site(s) as the source domain. But they usually suffer from significant inter-site heterogeneity caused by the use of different scanners and/or scanning protocols and fail to build generalizable models that can well adapt to multiple target domains. In this article, we propose a dual-expert fMRI harmonization (DFH) framework for automated MDD diagnosis. Our DFH is designed to simultaneously exploit data from a single labeled source domain/site and two unlabeled target domains for mitigating data distribution differences across domains. Specifically, the DFH consists of a domain-generic student model and two domain-specific teacher/expert models that are jointly trained to perform knowledge distillation through a deep collaborative learning module. A student model with strong generalizability is finally derived, which can be well adapted to unseen target domains and analysis of other brain diseases. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first attempts to investigate multi-target fMRI harmonization for MDD diagnosis. Comprehensive experiments on 836 subjects with rs-fMRI data from 3 different sites show the superiority of our method. The discriminative brain functional connectivities identified by our method could be regarded as potential biomarkers for fMRI-related MDD diagnosis."
MICCAI-CDMRI 2023 QuantConn Challenge Findings on Achieving Robust Quantitative Connectivity through Harmonized Preprocessing of Diffusion MRI.,39606717,Bennett A Landman,Vanderbilt University,Department of Computer Science,"White matter alterations are increasingly implicated in neurological diseases and their progression. International-scale studies use diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) to qualitatively identify changes in white matter microstructure and connectivity. Yet, quantitative analysis of DW-MRI data is hindered by inconsistencies stemming from varying acquisition protocols. Specifically, there is a pressing need to harmonize the preprocessing of DW-MRI datasets to ensure the derivation of robust quantitative diffusion metrics across acquisitions. In the MICCAI-CDMRI 2023 QuantConn challenge, participants were provided raw data from the same individuals collected on the same scanner but with two different acquisitions and tasked with preprocessing the DW-MRI to minimize acquisition differences while retaining biological variation. Harmonized submissions are evaluated on the reproducibility and comparability of cross-acquisition bundle-wise microstructure measures, bundle shape features, and connectomics. The key innovations of the QuantConn challenge are that (1) we assess bundles and tractography in the context of harmonization for the first time, (2) we assess connectomics in the context of harmonization for the first time, and (3) we have 10x additional subjects over prior harmonization challenge, MUSHAC and 100x over SuperMUDI. We find that bundle surface area, fractional anisotropy, connectome assortativity, betweenness centrality, edge count, modularity, nodal strength, and participation coefficient measures are most biased by acquisition and that machine learning voxel-wise correction, RISH mapping, and NeSH methods effectively reduce these biases. In addition, microstructure measures AD, MD, RD, bundle length, connectome density, efficiency, and path length are least biased by these acquisition differences. A machine learning approach that learned voxel-wise cross-acquisition relationships was the most effective at harmonizing connectomic, microstructure, and macrostructure features, but requires the same subject be scanned at each site co-registered. NeSH, a spatial and angular resampling method, was also effective and has generalizable framework not reliant co-registration. Our code is available at https://github.com/nancynewlin-masi/QuantConn/."
Classification of psychedelics and psychoactive drugs based on brain-wide imaging of cellular c-Fos expression.,39939591,Alex C Kwan,Cornell University,Meinig School of Biomedical Engineering,"Psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA are psychoactive compounds that exert behavioral effects with distinguishable but also overlapping features. The growing interest in using these compounds as therapeutics necessitates preclinical assays that can accurately screen psychedelics and related analogs. We posit that a promising approach may be to measure drug action on markers of neural plasticity in native brain tissues. We therefore developed a pipeline for drug classification using light sheet fluorescence microscopy of immediate early gene expression at cellular resolution followed by machine learning. We tested male and female mice with a panel of drugs, including psilocybin, ketamine, 5-MeO-DMT, 6-fluoro-DET, MDMA, acute fluoxetine, chronic fluoxetine, and vehicle. In one-versus-rest classification, the exact drug was identified with 67% accuracy, significantly above the chance level of 12.5%. In one-versus-one classifications, psilocybin was discriminated from 5-MeO-DMT, ketamine, MDMA, or acute fluoxetine with >95% accuracy. We used Shapley additive explanation to pinpoint the brain regions driving the machine learning predictions. Our results suggest a unique approach for characterizing and validating psychoactive drugs with psychedelic properties."
Population modeling with machine learning can enhance measures of mental health - Open-data replication.,40568461,Janine Bijsterbosch,Washington University School of Medicine,Department of Radiology,"Efforts to predict trait phenotypes based on functional MRI data from large cohorts have been hampered by low prediction accuracy and/or small effect sizes. Although these findings are highly replicable, the small effect sizes are somewhat surprising given the presumed brain basis of phenotypic traits such as neuroticism and fluid intelligence. We aim to replicate previous work and additionally test multiple data manipulations that may improve prediction accuracy by addressing data pollution challenges. Specifically, we added additional fMRI features, averaged the target phenotype across multiple measurements to obtain more accurate estimates of the underlying trait, balanced the target phenotype's distribution through undersampling of majority scores, and identified data-driven subtypes to investigate the impact of between-participant heterogeneity. Our results replicated prior results from Dadi et al. (2021) in a larger sample. Each data manipulation further led to small but consistent improvements in prediction accuracy, which were largely additive when combining multiple data manipulations. Combining data manipulations (i.e., extended fMRI features, averaged target phenotype, balanced target phenotype distribution) led to a three-fold increase in prediction accuracy for fluid intelligence compared to prior work. These findings highlight the benefit of several relatively easy and low-cost data manipulations, which may positively impact future work."
Assessment of Neuroanatomical Endophenotypes of Autism Spectrum Disorder and Association With Characteristics of Individuals With Schizophrenia and the General Population.,37017948,Christos Davatzikos,University of Pennsylvania,AI 2 D Center for Data Science for Integrated Diagnostics,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with significant clinical, neuroanatomical, and genetic heterogeneity that limits precision diagnostics and treatment. To assess distinct neuroanatomical dimensions of ASD using novel semisupervised machine learning methods and to test whether the dimensions can serve as endophenotypes also in non-ASD populations. This cross-sectional study used imaging data from the publicly available Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) repositories as the discovery cohort. The ABIDE sample included individuals diagnosed with ASD aged between 16 and 64 years and age- and sex-match typically developing individuals. Validation cohorts included individuals with schizophrenia from the Psychosis Heterogeneity Evaluated via Dimensional Neuroimaging (PHENOM) consortium and individuals from the UK Biobank to represent the general population. The multisite discovery cohort included 16 internationally distributed imaging sites. Analyses were performed between March 2021 and March 2022. The trained semisupervised heterogeneity through discriminative analysis models were tested for reproducibility using extensive cross-validations. It was then applied to individuals from the PHENOM and the UK Biobank.

The stroke outcome optimization project: Acute ischemic strokes from a comprehensive stroke center.,39095364,Chris Rorden,University of South Carolina,Department of Psychology,"Stroke is a leading cause of disability, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is routinely acquired for acute stroke management. Publicly sharing these datasets can aid in the development of machine learning algorithms, particularly for lesion identification, brain health quantification, and prognosis. These algorithms thrive on large amounts of information, but require diverse datasets to avoid overfitting to specific populations or acquisitions. While there are many large public MRI datasets, few of these include acute stroke. We describe clinical MRI using diffusion-weighted, fluid-attenuated and T1-weighted modalities for 1715 individuals admitted in the upstate of South Carolina, of whom 1461 have acute ischemic stroke. Demographic and impairment data are provided for 1106 of the stroke survivors from this cohort. Our validation demonstrates that machine learning can leverage the imaging data to predict stroke severity as measured by the NIH Stroke Scale/Score (NIHSS). We share not only the raw data, but also the scripts for replicating our findings. These tools can aid in education, and provide a benchmark for validating improved methods."
Deploying a national clinical text processing infrastructure.,38146986,Suzanne R Tamang,Stanford University,Division of Immunology and Rheumatology,"Clinical text processing offers a promising avenue for improving multiple aspects of healthcare, though operational deployment remains a substantial challenge. This case report details the implementation of a national clinical text processing infrastructure within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Two foundational use cases, cancer case management and suicide and overdose prevention, illustrate how text processing can be practically implemented at scale for diverse clinical applications using shared services. Insights from these use cases underline both commonalities and differences, providing a replicable model for future text processing applications. This project enables more efficient initiation, testing, and future deployment of text processing models, streamlining the integration of these use cases into healthcare operations. This project implementation is in a large integrated health delivery system in the United States, but we expect the lessons learned to be relevant to any health system, including smaller local and regional health systems in the United States."
Machine Learning of Functional Connectivity to Biotype Alcohol and Nicotine Use Disorders.,37696489,Jinbo Bi,University of Connecticut,Department of Computer Science and Engineering,"Magnetic resonance imaging provides noninvasive tools to investigate alcohol use disorder (AUD) and nicotine use disorder (NUD) and neural phenotypes for genetic studies. A data-driven transdiagnostic approach could provide a new perspective on the neurobiology of AUD and NUD. Using samples of individuals with AUD (n = 140), individuals with NUD (n = 249), and healthy control participants (n = 461) from the UK Biobank, we integrated clinical, neuroimaging, and genetic markers to identify biotypes of AUD and NUD. We partitioned participants with AUD and NUD based on resting-state functional connectivity (FC) features associated with clinical metrics. A multitask artificial neural network was trained to evaluate the cluster-defined biotypes and jointly infer AUD and NUD diagnoses. Three biotypes-primary NUD, mixed NUD/AUD with depression and anxiety, and mixed AUD/NUD-were identified. Multitask classifiers incorporating biotype knowledge achieved higher area under the curve (AUD: 0.76, NUD: 0.74) than single-task classifiers without biotype differentiation (AUD: 0.61, NUD: 0.64). Cerebellar FC features were important in distinguishing the 3 biotypes. The biotype of mixed NUD/AUD with depression and anxiety demonstrated the largest number of FC features (n = 5), all related to the visual cortex, that significantly differed from healthy control participants and were validated in a replication sample (p < .05). A polymorphism in TNRC6A was associated with the mixed AUD/NUD biotype in both the discovery (p = 7.3 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) and replication (p = 4.2 × 10<sup>-2</sup>) sets. Biotyping and multitask learning using FC features can characterize the clinical and genetic profiles of AUD and NUD and help identify cerebellar and visual circuit markers to differentiate the AUD/NUD group from the healthy control group. These markers support a new growing body of literature."
Differing Effects of Alcohol Use on Epigenetic and Brain Age in Adult Children of Parents with Alcohol Use Disorder.,39766462,Lee A Baugh,University of South Dakota,Division of Basic Biomedical Sciences & Center for Brain and Behavior Research,"It is known that being the adult child of a parent with an alcohol use disorder (ACoA) can confer a wide variety of increased health and psychological risks, including higher rates of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. Additionally, ACoAs are at greater risk of developing alcohol/substance use disorders (AUDs/SUDs) than individuals from families without a history of AUDs. ACoA individuals with risky hazardous alcohol use (<i>n</i> = 14) and those not engaged in hazardous use (<i>n</i> = 14) were compared to a group of healthy controls. We examined structural brain differences and applied machine learning algorithms to predict biological brain and DNA methylation ages to investigate differences and determine any accelerated aging between these groups. Hazardous and non-hazardous ACoA groups had lower predicted brain ages than the healthy control group (<i>n</i> = 100), which may result from neuro-developmental differences between ACoA groups and controls. Within specific brain regions, we observed decreased cortical volume within bilateral pars orbitalis and frontal poles, and the left middle temporal gyrus and entorhinal cortex within the hazardous alcohol ACoA group. When looking at the epigenetic aging data, the hazardous ACoA participants had increased predicted epigenetic age difference scores compared to the control group (<i>n</i> = 34) and the non-hazardous ACoA participant groups. The results demonstrate a decreased brain age in the ACoAs compared to control, concurrent with increased epigenetic age specifically in the hazardous ACoA group, laying the foundation for future research to identify individuals with an increased susceptibility to developing hazardous alcohol use. Together, these results provide a better understanding of the associations between epigenetic factors, brain structure, and alcohol use disorders."
Differential gray matter correlates and machine learning prediction of abuse and internalizing psychopathology in adolescent females.,39753729,Ryan J Herringa,University of Wisconsin School of Medicine & Public Health,Department of Psychiatry,"Childhood abuse represents one of the most potent risk factors for the development of psychopathology during childhood, accounting for 30-60% of the risk for onset. While previous studies have separately associated reductions in gray matter volume (GMV) with childhood abuse and internalizing psychopathology (IP), it is unclear whether abuse and IP differ in their structural abnormalities, and which GMV features are related to abuse and IP at the individual level. In a pooled multisite, multi-investigator sample, 246 child and adolescent females between the ages of 8-18 were recruited into studies of interpersonal violence (IPV) and/or IP (i.e. posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and/or anxiety). Youth completed assessments for IP, childhood abuse history, and underwent high resolution T1 structural MRI. First, we characterized how differences in GMV associated with childhood abuse exposure depend on the presence or absence of IP using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Next, we trained convolutional neural networks to predict individual psychopathology and abuse experience and estimated the strength and direction of importance of each structural feature in making individual-level predictions using Shapley values. Shapley values were aggregated across the entire cohort, and the top 1% of feature clusters with the highest importance are reported. At a group-level, VBM analyses identified widespread decreases in GMV across the prefrontal cortex, insula, and hippocampus in youth with IP, while abuse experience was specifically associated with increased GMV in the cingulate cortex and supramarginal gyrus. Further, interactions between IP and severity of abuse were identified in the ventral and dorsal prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and thalamus. After extensive training, model tuning, and model evaluation, the neural networks performed above chance when predicting IP (63% accuracy) and abuse experiences (71% accuracy) at the level of the individual. Interestingly, structural regions with the highest importance in making individual IP predictions had a high degree of overlap with group-level patterns. We have identified unique structural correlates of childhood abuse and IP on both the group and individual level with a high degree of overlap, providing evidence that IP and trauma exposure may uniquely and jointly impact child and adolescent structural neurodevelopment. Feature learning may offer power and novelty above and beyond traditional group-level approaches to the identification of biomarkers and a movement towards individualized diagnosis and treatment."
3-Dimensional morphological characterization of neuroretinal microglia in Alzheimer's disease via machine learning.,39719599,Joanne A Matsubara,The University of British Columbia,Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease that affects 47.5 million people worldwide. AD is characterised by the formation of plaques containing extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyper-phosphorylated tau proteins (pTau). Aβ gradually accumulates in the brain up to 20 years before the clinical onset of dementia, making it a compelling candidate for early detection of AD. It has been shown that there is increased deposition of Aβs in AD patients' retinas. However, little is known about microglia's ability to function and clear Aβ within the retina of AD and control eyes. We labelled microglia with ionised calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA-1) in AD and age-matched control donor retinas. We then used interactive machine learning to segment individual microglia in 3D. In the temporal mid-peripheral region, we found that the number of microglia was significantly lower in AD retinas compared to controls. Unexpectedly, the size of the microglia was significantly larger in the AD retinas compared to controls. We also labelled retinal microglia for Cluster of Differentiation 68 (CD68), a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed by cells in the monocyte lineage and a marker of phagocytic activity and activated microglia. The size of CD68 + cells was statistically different between AD and control microglial, with CD68 + cells being larger in AD. In contrast, there was no difference in either size or shape for CD68- microglia between the two groups, suggesting an important difference in the active states of CD68 + microglia in AD retina. There was also significantly increased CD68 immunoreactivity in individual microglia within the AD group. Overall, this study reveals unique differences in the size and activity of the retinal microglia, which may relate to their potential chronic activation due to increased levels of Aβs in the AD retina."
Digital phenotyping from wearables using AI characterizes psychiatric disorders and identifies genetic associations.,39706190,Mark Gerstein,Yale University,N/A,"Psychiatric disorders are influenced by genetic and environmental factors. However, their study is hindered by limitations on precisely characterizing human behavior. New technologies such as wearable sensors show promise in surmounting these limitations in that they measure heterogeneous behavior in a quantitative and unbiased fashion. Here, we analyze wearable and genetic data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. Leveraging >250 wearable-derived features as digital phenotypes, we show that an interpretable AI framework can objectively classify adolescents with psychiatric disorders more accurately than previously possible. To relate digital phenotypes to the underlying genetics, we show how they can be employed in univariate and multivariate genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Doing so, we identify 16 significant genetic loci and 37 psychiatric-associated genes, including ELFN1 and ADORA3, demonstrating that continuous, wearable-derived features give greater detection power than traditional case-control GWASs. Overall, we show how wearable technology can help uncover new linkages between behavior and genetics."
Fast intraoperative detection of primary central nervous system lymphoma and differentiation from common central nervous system tumors using stimulated Raman histology and deep learning.,39673805,Daniel A Orringer,New York Grossman School of Medicine,Department of Pathology,"Accurate intraoperative diagnosis is crucial for differentiating between primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma (PCNSL) and other CNS entities, guiding surgical decision-making, but represents significant challenges due to overlapping histomorphological features, time constraints, and differing treatment strategies. We combined stimulated Raman histology (SRH) with deep learning to address this challenge. We imaged unprocessed, label-free tissue samples intraoperatively using a portable Raman scattering microscope, generating virtual H&E-like images within <3 min. We developed a deep learning pipeline called RapidLymphoma based on a self-supervised learning strategy to (1) detect PCNSL, (2) differentiate from other CNS entities, and (3) test the diagnostic performance in a prospective international multicenter cohort and 2 additional independent test cohorts. We trained on 54 000 SRH patch images sourced from surgical resections and stereotactic-guided biopsies, including various CNS neoplastic/nonneoplastic lesions. Training and test data were collected from 4 tertiary international medical centers. The final histopathological diagnosis served as ground truth. In the prospective test cohort of PCNSL and non-PCNSL entities (n = 160), RapidLymphoma achieved an overall balanced accuracy of 97.81% ± 0.91, non-inferior to frozen section analysis in detecting PCNSL (100% vs. 77.77%). The additional test cohorts (n = 420, n = 59) reached balanced accuracy rates of 95.44% ± 0.74 and 95.57% ± 2.47 in differentiating IDH-wildtype diffuse gliomas and various brain metastasis from PCNSL. Visual heatmaps revealed RapidLymphoma's capabilities to detect class-specific histomorphological key features. RapidLymphoma proves reliable and valid for intraoperative PCNSL detection and differentiation from other CNS entities. It provides visual feedback within 3 min, enabling fast clinical decision-making and subsequent treatment strategy planning."
Brain Age Is Not a Significant Predictor of Relapse Risk in Late-Life Depression.,39349179,Carmen Andreescu,University of Pittsburgh,Department of Psychiatry,"Late-life depression (LLD) has been associated cross-sectionally with lower brain structural volumes and accelerated brain aging compared with healthy control participants (HCs). There are few longitudinal studies on the neurobiological predictors of recurrence in LLD. We tested a machine learning brain age model and its prospective association with LLD recurrence risk. We recruited individuals with LLD (n = 102) and HCs (n = 43) into a multisite, 2-year longitudinal study. Individuals with LLD were enrolled within 4 months of remission. Remitted participants with LLD underwent baseline neuroimaging and longitudinal clinical follow-up. Over 2 years, 43 participants with LLD relapsed and 59 stayed in remission. We used a previously developed machine learning brain age algorithm to compute brain age at baseline, and we evaluated brain age group differences (HC vs. LLD and HC vs. remitted LLD vs. relapsed LLD). We conducted a Cox proportional hazards model to evaluate whether baseline brain age predicted time to relapse. We found that brain age did not significantly differ between the HC and LLD groups or between the HC, remitted LLD, and relapsed LLD groups. Brain age did not significantly predict time to relapse. In contrast to our hypothesis, we found that brain age did not differ between control participants without depression and individuals with remitted LLD, and brain age was not associated with subsequent recurrence. This is in contrast to existing literature which has identified baseline brain age differences in late life but consistent with work that has shown no differences between people who do and do not relapse on gross structural measures."

The key innovations of the QuantConn challenge are that (1) we assess bundles and tractography in the context of harmonization for the first time, (2) we assess connectomics in the context of harmonization for the first time, and (3) we have 10x additional subjects over prior harmonization challenge, MUSHAC and 100x over SuperMUDI. We find that bundle surface area, fractional anisotropy, connectome assortativity, betweenness centrality, edge count, modularity, nodal strength, and participation coefficient measures are most biased by acquisition and that machine learning voxel-wise correction, RISH mapping, and NeSH methods effectively reduce these biases. In addition, microstructure measures AD, MD, RD, bundle length, connectome density, efficiency, and path length are least biased by these acquisition differences. A machine learning approach that learned voxel-wise cross-acquisition relationships was the most effective at harmonizing connectomic, microstructure, and macrostructure features, but requires the same subject be scanned at each site co-registered. NeSH, a spatial and angular resampling method, was also effective and has generalizable framework not reliant co-registration.

Seeing beyond the symptoms: biomarkers and brain regions linked to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.,38813532,Abbas Babajani-Feremi,University of Florida,Department of Neurology,"Early Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis remains challenging, necessitating specific biomarkers for timely detection. This study aimed to identify such biomarkers and explore their associations with cognitive decline. A cohort of 1759 individuals across cognitive aging stages, including healthy controls (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD, was examined. Utilizing nine biomarkers from structural MRI (sMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and positron emission tomography (PET), predictions were made for Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDRSB), and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS). Biomarkers included four sMRI (e.g., average thickness [ATH]), four DTI (e.g., mean diffusivity [MD]), and one PET Amyloid-β (Aβ) measure. Ensemble regression tree (ERT) technique with bagging and random forest approaches were applied in four groups (HC/MCI, HC/AD, MCI/AD, and HC/MCI/AD). Aβ emerged as a robust predictor of cognitive scores, particularly in late-stage AD. Volumetric measures, notably ATH, consistently correlated with cognitive scores across early and late disease stages. Additionally, ADAS demonstrated links to various neuroimaging biomarkers in all subject groups, highlighting its efficacy in monitoring brain changes throughout disease progression. ERT identified key brain regions associated with cognitive scores, such as the right transverse temporal region for Aβ, left and right entorhinal cortex, left inferior temporal gyrus, and left middle temporal gyrus for ATH, and the left uncinate fasciculus for MD. This study underscores the importance of an interdisciplinary approach in understanding AD mechanisms, offering potential contributions to early biomarker development."
Using machine learning to determine a functional classifier of reward responsiveness and its association with adolescent psychiatric symptomatology.,39552378,Sahil Bajaj,The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center,Department of Cancer Systems Imaging,"Machine learning (ML) has developed classifiers differentiating patient groups despite concerns regarding diagnostic reliability. An alternative strategy, used here, is to develop a functional classifier (hyperplane) (e.g. distinguishing the neural responses to received reward <i>v.</i> received punishment in typically developing (TD) adolescents) and then determine the functional integrity of the response (reward response distance from the hyperplane) in adolescents with externalizing and internalizing conditions and its associations with symptom clusters. Two hundred and ninety nine adolescents (mean age = 15.07 ± 2.30 years, 117 females) were divided into three groups: a training sample of TD adolescents where the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was applied (<i>N</i> = 65; 32 females), and two test groups- an independent sample of TD adolescents (<i>N</i> = 39; 14 females) and adolescents with a psychiatric diagnosis (major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) & conduct disorder (CD); <i>N</i> = 195, 71 females). SVM ML analysis identified a hyperplane with accuracy = 80.77%, sensitivity = 78.38% and specificity = 88.99% that implicated feature neural regions associated with reward <i>v.</i> punishment (e.g. nucleus accumbens <i>v.</i> anterior insula cortices). Adolescents with externalizing diagnoses were significantly less likely to show a normative and significantly more likely to show a deficient reward response than the TD samples. Deficient reward response was associated with elevated CD, MDD, and ADHD symptoms. Distinguishing the response to reward relative to punishment in TD adolescents via ML indicated notable disruptions in this response in patients with CD and ADHD and associations between reward responsiveness and CD, MDD, and ADHD symptom severity."
Hypoactivation of the Ventromedial Frontal Cortex in Major Depressive Disorder: A Magnetoencephalography Study of the Reward Positivity.,39551134,James F Cavanagh,University of New Mexico,Department of Psychology,"The reward positivity (RewP) is a sensitive and specific electrophysiological marker of reward receipt. These characteristics make it a compelling candidate marker of dysfunctional reward processing in major depressive disorder. We previously proposed that the RewP is a temporal nexus for multiple dimensions of reward value and that a diminished RewP in depression might only reflect a deficit in some of these features. Specifically, we predicted a diminished ventromedial contribution in depression in the context of maintained reward learning. We collected magnetoencephalography recordings of reward receipt in 43 individuals with major depressive disorder (35 female) and 38 healthy control individuals (21 female). Magnetoencephalography allows effective source estimation due to the absence of volume conduction that compromises electroencephalographic recordings. The magnetoencephalography RewP analog was generated by a broad set of cortical areas, but only right ventromedial and right ventral temporal areas were diminished in major depressive disorder. These areas correlated with a principal component of anhedonia derived from multiple questionnaires. Compellingly, Brodmann area 25 was the frontal region with the largest representation in both of these effects. These findings not only advance our understanding underlying the computation of the RewP, but are also consistent with findings from other types of functional source imaging in depression, as well as from deep brain stimulation treatments. Together, these discoveries suggest that the RewP may be a valuable marker for objective assessment of reward affect and its disruption in anhedonia."
Intensive longitudinal assessment following index trauma to predict development of PTSD using machine learning.,38723405,Srijan Sen,University of Michigan,Department of Psychiatry,"There are significant challenges to identifying which individuals require intervention following exposure to trauma, and a need for strategies to identify and provide individuals at risk for developing PTSD with timely interventions. The present study seeks to identify a minimal set of trauma-related symptoms, assessed during the weeks following traumatic exposure, that can accurately predict PTSD. Participants were 2185 adults (Mean age=36.4 years; 64% women; 50% Black) presenting for emergency care following traumatic exposure. Participants received a 'flash survey' with 6-8 varying symptoms (from a pool of 26 trauma symptoms) several times per week for eight weeks following the trauma exposure (each symptom assessed ∼6 times). Features (mean, sd, last, worst, peak-end scores) from the repeatedly assessed symptoms were included as candidate variables in a CART machine learning analysis to develop a pragmatic predictive algorithm. PTSD (PCL-5 ≥38) was present for 669 (31%) participants at the 8-week follow-up. A classification tree with three splits, based on mean scores of nervousness, rehashing, and fatigue, predicted PTSD with an Area Under the Curve of 0.836. Findings suggest feasibility for a 3-item assessment protocol, delivered once per week, following traumatic exposure to assess and potentially facilitate follow-up care for those at risk."
"Machine Learning for Mental Health: Applications, Challenges, and the Clinician's Role.",39523249,Allison G Dempsey,University of Colorado School of Medicine,Department of Psychiatry,"This review aims to evaluate the current psychiatric applications and limitations of machine learning (ML), defined as techniques used to train algorithms to improve performance at a task based on data. The review emphasizes the clinician's role in ensuring equitable and effective patient care and seeks to inform mental health providers about the importance of clinician involvement in these technologies. ML in psychiatry has advanced through electronic health record integration, disease phenotyping, and remote monitoring through mobile applications. However, these applications face challenges related to health equity, privacy, translation to practice, and validation. Clinicians play crucial roles in ensuring data quality, mitigating biases, promoting algorithm transparency, guiding clinical implementation, and advocating for ethical and patient-centered use of ML tools. Clinicians are essential in addressing the challenges of ML, ensuring its ethical application, and promoting equitable care, thus improving the effectiveness of ML in practice."
"Latent cognitive phenotypes in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy: Clinical, sociodemographic, and neuroimaging associations.",39487825,Bruce P Hermann,University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health,Department of Neurology,"Application of cluster analytic procedures has advanced understanding of the cognitive heterogeneity inherent in diverse epilepsy syndromes and the associated clinical and neuroimaging features. Application of this unsupervised machine learning approach to the neuropsychological performance of persons with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) has yet to be attempted, which is the intent of this investigation. A total of 77 JME participants, 19 unaffected siblings, and 44 unrelated controls, 12 to 25 years of age, were administered a comprehensive neuropsychological battery (intelligence, language, memory, executive function, and processing speed), which was subjected to factor analysis followed by K-means clustering of the resultant factor scores. Identified cognitive phenotypes were characterized and related to clinical, family, sociodemographic, and cortical and subcortical imaging features. Factor analysis revealed three underlying cognitive dimensions (general ability, speed/response inhibition, and learning/memory), with JME participants performing worse than unrelated controls across all factor scores, and unaffected siblings performing worse than unrelated controls on the general mental ability and learning/memory factors, with no JME vs sibling differences. K-means clustering of the factor scores revealed three latent groups including above average (31.4% of participants), average (52.1%), and abnormal performance (16.4%). Participant groups differed in their distributions across the latent groups (p < 0.001), with 23% JME, 22% siblings, and 2% unrelated controls in the abnormal performance group; and 18% JME, 21% siblings, and 59% unrelated controls in the above average group. Clinical epilepsy variables were unassociated with cluster membership, whereas family factors (lower parental education) and abnormally increased thickness and/or volume in the frontal, parietal, and temporal-occipital regions were associated with the abnormal cognition group. Distinct cognitive phenotypes characterize the spectrum of neuropsychological performance of patients with JME for which there is familial (sibling) aggregation. Phenotypic membership was associated with parental (education) and imaging characteristics (increased cortical thickness and volume) but not basic clinical seizure features."
Emerging many-to-one weighted mapping in hippocampus-amygdala network underlies memory formation.,39461946,Dong V Wang,Drexel University College of Medicine,Department of Neurobiology & Anatomy,"Memories are crucial for daily life, yet the network-level organizing principles governing neural representations of experiences remain unknown. Employing dual-site in vivo recording in freely behaving male mice, here we show that hippocampal dorsal CA1 (dCA1) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) utilize distinct coding strategies for novel experiences. A small assembly of BLA neurons emerged active during memory acquisition and persisted through consolidation, whereas most dCA1 neurons were engaged in both processes. Machine learning decoding revealed that dCA1 population spikes predicted BLA assembly firing rate, suggesting that most dCA1 neurons concurrently index an episodic event by rapidly establishing weighted communication with a specific BLA assembly - a process we term ""many-to-one weighted mapping."" We also found that dCA1 reactivations preceded BLA assembly activity preferably during elongated and enlarged dCA1 ripples. Using a closed-loop strategy, we demonstrated that suppressing BLA activity after large dCA1 ripples impaired memory. These findings highlight a many-to-one weighted mapping mechanism underlying both the acquisition and consolidation of new memories."
Exploring the impact of biological sex on intrinsic connectivity networks in PTSD: A data-driven approach.,39447688,Ruth A Lanius,Atlas Institute for Veterans and Families,N/A,"Sex as a biological variable (SABV) may help to account for the differential development and expression of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among trauma-exposed males and females. Here, we investigate the impact of SABV on PTSD-related neural alterations in resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) within three core intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs): the salience network (SN), central executive network (CEN), and default mode network (DMN). Using an independent component analysis (ICA), we compared rsFC of the SN, CEN, and DMN between males and females, with and without PTSD (n = 47 females with PTSD, n = 34 males with PTSD, n = 36 healthy control females, n = 20 healthy control males) via full factorial ANCOVAs. Additionally, linear regression analyses were conducted with clinical variables (i.e., PTSD and depression symptoms, childhood trauma scores) in order to determine intrinsic network connectivity characteristics specific to SABV. Furthermore, we utilized machine learning classification models to predict the biological sex and PTSD diagnosis of individual participants based on intrinsic network activity patterns. Our findings revealed differential network connectivity patterns based on SABV and PTSD diagnosis. Males with PTSD exhibited increased intra-SN (i.e., SN-anterior insula) rsFC and increased DMN-right superior parietal lobule/precuneus/superior occipital gyrus rsFC as compared to females with PTSD. There were also differential network connectivity patterns for comparisons between the PTSD and healthy control groups for males and females, separately. We did not observe significant correlations between clinical measures of interest and brain region clusters which displayed significant between group differences as a function of biological sex, thus further reinforcing that SABV analyses are likely not confounded by these variables. Furthermore, machine learning classification models accurately predicted biological sex and PTSD diagnosis among novel/unseen participants based on ICN activation patterns. This study reveals groundbreaking insights surrounding the impact of SABV on PTSD-related ICN alterations using data-driven methods. Our discoveries contribute to further defining neurobiological markers of PTSD among females and males and may offer guidance for differential sex-related treatment needs."
Assessing the association between global structural brain age and polygenic risk for schizophrenia in early adulthood: A recall-by-genotype study.,38154374,Esther Walton,University of Bath,Department of Psychology,"Neuroimaging studies consistently show advanced brain age in schizophrenia, suggesting that brain structure is often 'older' than expected at a given chronological age. Whether advanced brain age is linked to genetic liability for schizophrenia remains unclear. In this pre-registered secondary data analysis, we utilised a recall-by-genotype approach applied to a population-based subsample from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children to assess brain age differences between young adults aged 21-24 years with relatively high (n = 96) and low (n = 93) polygenic risk for schizophrenia (SCZ-PRS). A global index of brain age (or brain-predicted age) was estimated using a publicly available machine learning model previously trained on a combination of region-wise gray-matter measures, including cortical thickness, surface area and subcortical volumes derived from T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. We found no difference in mean brain-PAD (the difference between brain-predicted age and chronological age) between the high- and low-SCZ-PRS groups, controlling for the effects of sex and age at time of scanning (b = -.21; 95% CI -2.00, 1.58; p = .82; Cohen's d = -.034; partial R<sup>2</sup> = .00029). These findings do not support an association between SCZ-PRS and brain-PAD based on global age-related structural brain patterns, suggesting that brain age may not be a vulnerability marker of common genetic risk for SCZ. Future studies with larger samples and multimodal brain age measures could further investigate global or localised effects of SCZ-PRS."
Assessment of Neuroanatomical Endophenotypes of Autism Spectrum Disorder and Association With Characteristics of Individuals With Schizophrenia and the General Population.,37017948,Christos Davatzikos,University of Pennsylvania,AI 2 D Center for Data Science for Integrated Diagnostics,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with significant clinical, neuroanatomical, and genetic heterogeneity that limits precision diagnostics and treatment. To assess distinct neuroanatomical dimensions of ASD using novel semisupervised machine learning methods and to test whether the dimensions can serve as endophenotypes also in non-ASD populations. This cross-sectional study used imaging data from the publicly available Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) repositories as the discovery cohort. The ABIDE sample included individuals diagnosed with ASD aged between 16 and 64 years and age- and sex-match typically developing individuals. Validation cohorts included individuals with schizophrenia from the Psychosis Heterogeneity Evaluated via Dimensional Neuroimaging (PHENOM) consortium and individuals from the UK Biobank to represent the general population. The multisite discovery cohort included 16 internationally distributed imaging sites. Analyses were performed between March 2021 and March 2022. The trained semisupervised heterogeneity through discriminative analysis models were tested for reproducibility using extensive cross-validations. It was then applied to individuals from the PHENOM and the UK Biobank. It was hypothesized that neuroanatomical dimensions of ASD would display distinct clinical and genetic profiles and would be prominent also in non-ASD populations. Heterogeneity through discriminative analysis models trained on T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance images of 307 individuals with ASD (mean [SD] age, 25.4 [9.8] years; 273 [88.9%] male) and 362 typically developing control individuals (mean [SD] age, 25.8 [8.9] years; 309 [85.4%] male) revealed that a 3-dimensional scheme was optimal to capture the ASD neuroanatomy. The first dimension (A1: aginglike) was associated with smaller brain volume, lower cognitive function, and aging-related genetic variants (FOXO3; Z = 4.65; P = 1.62 × 10-6). The second dimension (A2: schizophrenialike) was characterized by enlarged subcortical volumes, antipsychotic medication use (Cohen d = 0.65; false discovery rate-adjusted P = .048), partially overlapping genetic, neuroanatomical characteristics to schizophrenia (n = 307), and significant genetic heritability estimates in the general population (n = 14 786; mean [SD] h2, 0.71 [0.04]; P < 1 × 10-4). The third dimension (A3: typical ASD) was distinguished by enlarged cortical volumes, high nonverbal cognitive performance, and biological pathways implicating brain development and abnormal apoptosis (mean [SD] β, 0.83 [0.02]; P = 4.22 × 10-6). This cross-sectional study discovered 3-dimensional endophenotypic representation that may elucidate the heterogeneous neurobiological underpinnings of ASD to support precision diagnostics. The significant correspondence between A2 and schizophrenia indicates a possibility of identifying common biological mechanisms across the 2 mental health diagnoses."
Decoding the role of transcriptomic clocks in the human prefrontal cortex.,37163025,Janitza L Montalvo-Ortiz,Yale University School of Medicine,Division of Human Genetics,"Aging is a complex process with interindividual variability, which can be measured by aging biological clocks. Aging clocks are machine-learning algorithms guided by biological information and associated with mortality risk and a wide range of health outcomes. One of these aging clocks are transcriptomic clocks, which uses gene expression data to predict biological age; however, their functional role is unknown. Here, we profiled two transcriptomic clocks (RNAAgeCalc and knowledge-based deep neural network clock) in a large dataset of human postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) samples. We identified that deep-learning transcriptomic clock outperforms RNAAgeCalc to predict transcriptomic age in the human PFC. We identified associations of transcriptomic clocks with psychiatric-related traits. Further, we applied system biology algorithms to identify common gene networks among both clocks and performed pathways enrichment analyses to assess its functionality and prioritize genes involved in the aging processes. Identified gene networks showed enrichment for diseases of signal transduction by growth factor receptors and second messenger pathways. We also observed enrichment of genome-wide signals of mental and physical health outcomes and identified genes previously associated with human brain aging. Our findings suggest a link between transcriptomic aging and health disorders, including psychiatric traits. Further, it reveals functional genes within the human PFC that may play an important role in aging and health risk."
Brain Age Is Not a Significant Predictor of Relapse Risk in Late-Life Depression.,39349179,Carmen Andreescu,University of Pittsburgh,Department of Psychiatry,"Late-life depression (LLD) has been associated cross-sectionally with lower brain structural volumes and accelerated brain aging compared with healthy control participants (HCs). There are few longitudinal studies on the neurobiological predictors of recurrence in LLD. We tested a machine learning brain age model and its prospective association with LLD recurrence risk. We recruited individuals with LLD (n = 102) and HCs (n = 43) into a multisite, 2-year longitudinal study. Individuals with LLD were enrolled within 4 months of remission. Remitted participants with LLD underwent baseline neuroimaging and longitudinal clinical follow-up. Over 2 years, 43 participants with LLD relapsed and 59 stayed in remission. We used a previously developed machine learning brain age algorithm to compute brain age at baseline, and we evaluated brain age group differences (HC vs. LLD and HC vs. remitted LLD vs. relapsed LLD). We conducted a Cox proportional hazards model to evaluate whether baseline brain age predicted time to relapse. We found that brain age did not significantly differ between the HC and LLD groups or between the HC, remitted LLD, and relapsed LLD groups. Brain age did not significantly predict time to relapse. In contrast to our hypothesis, we found that brain age did not differ between control participants without depression and individuals with remitted LLD, and brain age was not associated with subsequent recurrence. This is in contrast to existing literature which has identified baseline brain age differences in late life but consistent with work that has shown no differences between people who do and do not relapse on gross structural measures."
The stroke outcome optimization project: Acute ischemic strokes from a comprehensive stroke center.,39095364,Chris Rorden,University of South Carolina,Department of Psychology,"Stroke is a leading cause of disability, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is routinely acquired for acute stroke management. Publicly sharing these datasets can aid in the development of machine learning algorithms, particularly for lesion identification, brain health quantification, and prognosis. These algorithms thrive on large amounts of information, but require diverse datasets to avoid overfitting to specific populations or acquisitions. While there are many large public MRI datasets, few of these include acute stroke. We describe clinical MRI using diffusion-weighted, fluid-attenuated and T1-weighted modalities for 1715 individuals admitted in the upstate of South Carolina, of whom 1461 have acute ischemic stroke. Demographic and impairment data are provided for 1106 of the stroke survivors from this cohort. Our validation demonstrates that machine learning can leverage the imaging data to predict stroke severity as measured by the NIH Stroke Scale/Score (NIHSS). We share not only the raw data, but also the scripts for replicating our findings. These tools can aid in education, and provide a benchmark for validating improved methods."
Neurodevelopmental subtypes of functional brain organization in the ABCD study using a rigorous analytic framework.,39245397,Marie T Banich,University of Colorado Boulder,Department of Psychology and Neuroscience,"The current study demonstrates that an individual's resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) is a dependable biomarker for identifying differential patterns of cognitive and emotional functioning during late childhood. Using baseline RSFC data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, which includes children aged 9-11, we identified four distinct RSFC subtypes. We introduce an integrated methodological pipeline for testing the reliability and importance of these subtypes. In the Identification phase, Leiden Community Detection defined RSFC subtypes, with their reproducibility confirmed through a split-sample technique in the Validation stage. The Evaluation phase showed that distinct cognitive and mental health profiles are associated with each subtype, with the Predictive phase indicating that subtypes better predict various cognitive and mental health characteristics than individual RSFC connections. The Replication stage employed bootstrapping and down-sampling methods to substantiate the reproducibility of these subtypes further. This work allows future explorations of developmental trajectories of these RSFC subtypes."
A tale of two lexica: Investigating computational pressures on word representation with neural networks.,37051161,David W Gow,Massachusetts General Hospital,Department of Neurology,"The notion of a single localized store of word representations has become increasingly less plausible as evidence has accumulated for the widely distributed neural representation of wordform grounded in motor, perceptual, and conceptual processes. Here, we attempt to combine machine learning methods and neurobiological frameworks to propose a computational model of brain systems potentially responsible for wordform representation. We tested the hypothesis that the functional specialization of word representation in the brain is driven partly by computational optimization. This hypothesis directly addresses the unique problem of mapping sound and articulation vs. mapping sound and meaning. We found that artificial neural networks trained on the mapping between sound and articulation performed poorly in recognizing the mapping between sound and meaning and vice versa. Moreover, a network trained on both tasks simultaneously could not discover the features required for efficient mapping between sound and higher-level cognitive states compared to the other two models. Furthermore, these networks developed internal representations reflecting specialized task-optimized functions without explicit training. Together, these findings demonstrate that different task-directed representations lead to more focused responses and better performance of a machine or algorithm and, hypothetically, the brain. Thus, we imply that the functional specialization of word representation mirrors a computational optimization strategy given the nature of the tasks that the human brain faces."
Replicability and generalizability in population psychiatric neuroimaging.,39215207,Timothy O Laumann,Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine,Department of Psychiatry,"Studies linking mental health with brain function in cross-sectional population-based association studies have historically relied on small, underpowered samples. Given the small effect sizes typical of such brain-wide associations, studies require samples into the thousands to achieve the statistical power necessary for replicability. Here, we detail how small sample sizes have hampered replicability and provide sample size targets given established association strength benchmarks. Critically, while replicability will improve with larger samples, it is not guaranteed that observed effects will meaningfully apply to target populations of interest (i.e., be generalizable). We discuss important considerations related to generalizability in psychiatric neuroimaging and provide an example of generalizability failure due to ""shortcut learning"" in brain-based predictions of mental health phenotypes. Shortcut learning is a phenomenon whereby machine learning models learn an association between the brain and an unmeasured construct (the shortcut), rather than the intended target of mental health. Given the complex nature of brain-behavior interactions, the future of epidemiological approaches to brain-based studies of mental health will require large, diverse samples with comprehensive assessment."
Prediction of Postoperative Delirium in Older Adults from Preoperative Cognition and Occipital Alpha Power from Resting-State Electroencephalogram.,39185530,Mouhsin M Shafi,Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,Berenson-Allen Center for Noninvasive Brain Stimulation,"Postoperative delirium is the most common complication following surgery among older adults, and has been consistently associated with increased mortality and morbidity, cognitive decline, and loss of independence, as well as markedly increased health-care costs. Electroencephalography (EEG) spectral slowing has frequently been observed during episodes of delirium, whereas intraoperative frontal alpha power is associated with postoperative delirium. We sought to identify preoperative predictors that could identify individuals at high risk for postoperative delirium, which could guide clinical decision-making and enable targeted interventions to potentially decrease delirium incidence and postoperative delirium-related complications. In this prospective observational study, we used machine learning to evaluate whether baseline (preoperative) cognitive function and resting-state EEG could be used to identify patients at risk for postoperative delirium. Preoperative resting-state EEGs and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment were collected from 85 patients (age = 73 ± 6.4 years, 12 cases of delirium) undergoing elective surgery. The model with the highest f1-score was subsequently validated in an independent, prospective cohort of 51 older adults (age = 68 ± 5.2 years, 6 cases of delirium) undergoing elective surgery. Occipital alpha powers have higher f1-score than frontal alpha powers and EEG spectral slowing in the training cohort. Occipital alpha powers were able to predict postoperative delirium with AUC, specificity and accuracy all >90%, and sensitivity >80%, in the validation cohort. Notably, models incorporating transformed alpha powers and cognitive scores outperformed models incorporating occipital alpha powers alone or cognitive scores alone. While requiring prospective validation in larger cohorts, these results suggest that strong prediction of postoperative delirium may be feasible in clinical settings using simple and widely available clinical tools. Additionally, our results suggested that the thalamocortical circuit exhibits different EEG patterns under different stressors, with occipital alpha powers potentially reflecting baseline vulnerabilities."
"The presence, nature and network characteristics of behavioural phenotypes in temporal lobe epilepsy.",37038499,Bruce P Hermann,University of Wisconsin-Madison,Department of Neurology,"The relationship between temporal lobe epilepsy and psychopathology has had a long and contentious history with diverse views regarding the presence, nature and severity of emotional-behavioural problems in this patient population. To address these controversies, we take a new person-centred approach through the application of unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify underlying latent groups or behavioural phenotypes. Addressed are the distinct psychopathological profiles, their linked frequency, patterns and severity and the disruptions in morphological and network properties that underlie the identified latent groups. A total of 114 patients and 83 controls from the Epilepsy Connectome Project were administered the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment inventory from which six Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-oriented scales were analysed by unsupervised machine learning analytics to identify latent patient groups. Identified clusters were contrasted to controls as well as to each other in order to characterize their association with sociodemographic, clinical epilepsy and morphological and functional imaging network features. The concurrent validity of the behavioural phenotypes was examined through other measures of behaviour and quality of life. Patients overall exhibited significantly higher (abnormal) scores compared with controls. However, cluster analysis identified three latent groups: (i) unaffected, with no scale elevations compared with controls (Cluster 1, 37%); (ii) mild symptomatology characterized by significant elevations across several Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-oriented scales compared with controls (Cluster 2, 42%); and (iii) severe symptomatology with significant elevations across all scales compared with controls and the other temporal lobe epilepsy behaviour phenotype groups (Cluster 3, 21%). Concurrent validity of the behavioural phenotype grouping was demonstrated through identical stepwise links to abnormalities on independent measures including the National Institutes of Health Toolbox Emotion Battery and quality of life metrics. There were significant associations between cluster membership and sociodemographic (handedness and education), cognition (processing speed), clinical epilepsy (presence and lifetime number of tonic-clonic seizures) and neuroimaging characteristics (cortical volume and thickness and global graph theory metrics of morphology and resting-state functional MRI). Increasingly dispersed volumetric abnormalities and widespread disruptions in underlying network properties were associated with the most abnormal behavioural phenotype. Psychopathology in these patients is characterized by a series of discrete latent groups that harbour accompanying sociodemographic, clinical and neuroimaging correlates. The underlying neurobiological patterns suggest that the degree of psychopathology is linked to increasingly dispersed abnormal brain networks. Similar to cognition, machine learning approaches support a novel developing taxonomy of the comorbidities of epilepsy."

The Brain Tumor Segmentation - Metastases (BraTS-METS) Challenge 2023: Brain Metastasis Segmentation on Pre-treatment MRI.,37396600,Mariam Aboian,Children's Hospital of Philadelphia,Department of Radiology,"The translation of AI-generated brain metastases (BM) segmentation into clinical practice relies heavily on diverse, high-quality annotated medical imaging datasets. The BraTS-METS 2023 challenge has gained momentum for testing and benchmarking algorithms using rigorously annotated internationally compiled real-world datasets. This study presents the results of the segmentation challenge and characterizes the challenging cases that impacted the performance of the winning algorithms. Untreated brain metastases on standard anatomic MRI sequences (T1, T2, FLAIR, T1PG) from eight contributed international datasets were annotated in stepwise method: published UNET algorithms, student, neuroradiologist, final approver neuroradiologist. Segmentations were ranked based on lesion-wise Dice and Hausdorff distance (HD95) scores. False positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) were rigorously penalized, receiving a score of 0 for Dice and a fixed penalty of 374 for HD95. The mean scores for the teams were calculated. Eight datasets comprising 1303 studies were annotated, with 402 studies (3076 lesions) released on Synapse as publicly available datasets to challenge competitors. Additionally, 31 studies (139 lesions) were held out for validation, and 59 studies (218 lesions) were used for testing. Segmentation accuracy was measured as rank across subjects, with the winning team achieving a LesionWise mean score of 7.9. The Dice score for the winning team was 0.65 ± 0.25. Common errors among the leading teams included false negatives for small lesions and misregistration of masks in space. The Dice scores and lesion detection rates of all algorithms diminished with decreasing tumor size, particularly for tumors smaller than 100 mm3. In conclusion, algorithms for BM segmentation require further refinement to balance high sensitivity in lesion detection with the minimization of false positives and negatives. The BraTS-METS 2023 challenge successfully curated well-annotated, diverse datasets and identified common errors, facilitating the translation of BM segmentation across varied clinical environments and providing personalized volumetric reports to patients undergoing BM treatment."
Development of a machine learning algorithm to predict the residual cognitive reserve index.,39091422,Dan Mungas,University of California Davis School of Medicine,Department of Neurology,"Elucidating the mechanisms by which late-life neurodegeneration causes cognitive decline requires understanding why some individuals are more resilient than others to the effects of brain change on cognition (cognitive reserve). Currently, there is no way of measuring cognitive reserve that is valid (e.g. capable of moderating brain-cognition associations), widely accessible (e.g. does not require neuroimaging and large sample sizes), and able to provide insight into resilience-promoting mechanisms. To address these limitations, this study sought to determine whether a machine learning approach to combining standard clinical variables could (i) predict a residual-based cognitive reserve criterion standard and (ii) prospectively moderate brain-cognition associations. In a training sample combining data from the University of California (UC) Davis and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-2 (ADNI-2) cohort (<i>N</i> = 1665), we operationalized cognitive reserve using an MRI-based residual approach. An eXtreme Gradient Boosting machine learning algorithm was trained to predict this residual reserve index (RRI) using three models: Minimal (basic clinical data, such as age, education, anthropometrics, and blood pressure), Extended (Minimal model plus cognitive screening, word reading, and depression measures), and Full [Extended model plus Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and Everyday Cognition (ECog) scale]. External validation was performed in an independent sample of ADNI 1/3/GO participants (<i>N</i> = 1640), which examined whether the effects of brain change on cognitive change were moderated by the machine learning models' cognitive reserve estimates. The three machine learning models differed in their accuracy and validity. The Minimal model did not correlate strongly with the criterion standard (<i>r</i> = 0.23) and did not moderate the effects of brain change on cognitive change. In contrast, the Extended and Full models were modestly correlated with the criterion standard (<i>r</i> = 0.49 and 0.54, respectively) and prospectively moderated longitudinal brain-cognition associations, outperforming other cognitive reserve proxies (education, word reading). The primary difference between the Minimal model-which did not perform well as a measure of cognitive reserve-and the Extended and Full models-which demonstrated good accuracy and validity-is the lack of cognitive performance and informant-report data in the Minimal model. This suggests that basic clinical variables like anthropometrics, vital signs, and demographics are not sufficient for estimating cognitive reserve. Rather, the most accurate and valid estimates of cognitive reserve were obtained when cognitive performance data-ideally augmented by informant-reported functioning-was used. These results indicate that a dynamic and accessible proxy for cognitive reserve can be generated for individuals without neuroimaging data and gives some insight into factors that may promote resilience."
Population modeling with machine learning can enhance measures of mental health - Open-data replication.,40568461,Janine Bijsterbosch,Washington University School of Medicine,Department of Radiology,"Efforts to predict trait phenotypes based on functional MRI data from large cohorts have been hampered by low prediction accuracy and/or small effect sizes. Although these findings are highly replicable, the small effect sizes are somewhat surprising given the presumed brain basis of phenotypic traits such as neuroticism and fluid intelligence. We aim to replicate previous work and additionally test multiple data manipulations that may improve prediction accuracy by addressing data pollution challenges. Specifically, we added additional fMRI features, averaged the target phenotype across multiple measurements to obtain more accurate estimates of the underlying trait, balanced the target phenotype's distribution through undersampling of majority scores, and identified data-driven subtypes to investigate the impact of between-participant heterogeneity. Our results replicated prior results from Dadi et al. (2021) in a larger sample. Each data manipulation further led to small but consistent improvements in prediction accuracy, which were largely additive when combining multiple data manipulations. Combining data manipulations (i.e., extended fMRI features, averaged target phenotype, balanced target phenotype distribution) led to a three-fold increase in prediction accuracy for fluid intelligence compared to prior work. These findings highlight the benefit of several relatively easy and low-cost data manipulations, which may positively impact future work."
An arginine-rich nuclear localization signal (ArgiNLS) strategy for streamlined image segmentation of single cells.,39074275,Sam A Golden,University of Washington,Center of Excellence in Neurobiology of Addiction,"High-throughput volumetric fluorescent microscopy pipelines can spatially integrate whole-brain structure and function at the foundational level of single cells. However, conventional fluorescent protein (FP) modifications used to discriminate single cells possess limited efficacy or are detrimental to cellular health. Here, we introduce a synthetic and nondeleterious nuclear localization signal (NLS) tag strategy, called ""Arginine-rich NLS"" (ArgiNLS), that optimizes genetic labeling and downstream image segmentation of single cells by restricting FP localization near-exclusively in the nucleus through a poly-arginine mechanism. A single N-terminal ArgiNLS tag provides modular nuclear restriction consistently across spectrally separate FP variants. ArgiNLS performance in vivo displays functional conservation across major cortical cell classes and in response to both local and systemic brain-wide AAV administration. Crucially, the high signal-to-noise ratio afforded by ArgiNLS enhances machine learning-automated segmentation of single cells due to rapid classifier training and enrichment of labeled cell detection within 2D brain sections or 3D volumetric whole-brain image datasets, derived from both staining-amplified and native signal. This genetic strategy provides a simple and flexible basis for precise image segmentation of genetically labeled single cells at scale and paired with behavioral procedures."
Assessing spontaneous sensory neuron activity using in vivo calcium imaging.,38112748,George L Goodwin,King's College London,N/A,"Heightened spontaneous activity in sensory neurons is often reported in individuals living with chronic pain. It is possible to study this activity in rodents using electrophysiology, but these experiments require great skill and can be prone to bias. Here, we have examined whether in vivo calcium imaging with GCaMP6s can be used as an alternative approach. We show that spontaneously active calcium transients can be visualised in the fourth lumbar dorsal root ganglion (L4 DRG) through in vivo imaging in a mouse model of inflammatory pain. Application of lidocaine to the nerve, between the inflamed site and the DRG, silenced spontaneous firing and revealed the true baseline level of calcium for spontaneously active neurons. We used these data to train a machine learning algorithm to predict when a neuron is spontaneously active. We show that our algorithm is accurate in 2 different models of pain: intraplantar complete Freund adjuvant and antigen-induced arthritis, with accuracies of 90.0% ±1.2 and 85.9% ±2.1, respectively, assessed against visual inspection by an experienced observer. The algorithm can also detect neuronal activity in imaging experiments generated in a different laboratory using a different microscope configuration (accuracy = 94.0% ±2.2). We conclude that in vivo calcium imaging can be used to assess spontaneous activity in sensory neurons and provide a Google Colaboratory Notebook to allow anyone easy access to our novel analysis tool, for the assessment of spontaneous neuronal activity in their own imaging setups."
Medial prefrontal cortex neurotransmitter abnormalities in posttraumatic stress disorder with and without comorbidity to major depression.,39054694,Christoph Juchem,Columbia University School of Engineering and Applied Science,Columbia University School of Engineering and Applied Science,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic psychiatric condition that follows exposure to a traumatic stressor. Though previous in vivo proton (<sup>1</sup>H) MRS) research conducted at 4 T or lower has identified alterations in glutamate metabolism associated with PTSD predisposition and/or progression, no prior investigations have been conducted at higher field strength. In addition, earlier studies have not extensively addressed the impact of psychiatric comorbidities such as major depressive disorder (MDD) on PTSD-associated <sup>1</sup>H-MRS-visible brain metabolite abnormalities. Here we employ 7 T <sup>1</sup>H MRS to examine concentrations of glutamate, glutamine, GABA, and glutathione in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of PTSD patients with MDD (PTSD+<sub>MDD+</sub>; N = 6) or without MDD (PTSD+<sub>MDD-</sub>; N = 5), as well as trauma-unmatched controls without PTSD but with MDD (PTSD-<sub>MDD+</sub>; N = 9) or without MDD (PTSD-<sub>MDD-</sub>; N = 18). Participants with PTSD demonstrated decreased ratios of GABA to glutamine relative to healthy PTSD-<sub>MDD-</sub> controls but no single-metabolite abnormalities. When comorbid MDD was considered, however, MDD but not PTSD diagnosis was significantly associated with increased mPFC glutamine concentration and decreased glutamate:glutamine ratio. In addition, all participants with PTSD and/or MDD collectively demonstrated decreased glutathione relative to healthy PTSD-<sub>MDD-</sub> controls. Despite limited findings in single metabolites, patterns of abnormality in prefrontal metabolite concentrations among individuals with PTSD and/or MDD enabled supervised classification to separate them from healthy controls with 80+% sensitivity and specificity, with glutathione, glutamine, and myoinositol consistently among the most informative metabolites for this classification. Our findings indicate that MDD can be an important factor in mPFC glutamate metabolism abnormalities observed using <sup>1</sup>H MRS in cohorts with PTSD."
A tale of two lexica: Investigating computational pressures on word representation with neural networks.,37051161,David W Gow,Massachusetts General Hospital,Department of Neurology,"The notion of a single localized store of word representations has become increasingly less plausible as evidence has accumulated for the widely distributed neural representation of wordform grounded in motor, perceptual, and conceptual processes. Here, we attempt to combine machine learning methods and neurobiological frameworks to propose a computational model of brain systems potentially responsible for wordform representation. We tested the hypothesis that the functional specialization of word representation in the brain is driven partly by computational optimization. This hypothesis directly addresses the unique problem of mapping sound and articulation vs. mapping sound and meaning. We found that artificial neural networks trained on the mapping between sound and articulation performed poorly in recognizing the mapping between sound and meaning and vice versa. Moreover, a network trained on both tasks simultaneously could not discover the features required for efficient mapping between sound and higher-level cognitive states compared to the other two models. Furthermore, these networks developed internal representations reflecting specialized task-optimized functions without explicit training. Together, these findings demonstrate that different task-directed representations lead to more focused responses and better performance of a machine or algorithm and, hypothetically, the brain. Thus, we imply that the functional specialization of word representation mirrors a computational optimization strategy given the nature of the tasks that the human brain faces."
A causal roadmap for generating high-quality real-world evidence.,37900353,Maya Petersen,University of California,Department of Biostatistics,"Increasing emphasis on the use of real-world evidence (RWE) to support clinical policy and regulatory decision-making has led to a proliferation of guidance, advice, and frameworks from regulatory agencies, academia, professional societies, and industry. A broad spectrum of studies use real-world data (RWD) to produce RWE, ranging from randomized trials with outcomes assessed using RWD to fully observational studies. Yet, many proposals for generating RWE lack sufficient detail, and many analyses of RWD suffer from implausible assumptions, other methodological flaws, or inappropriate interpretations. The <i>Causal Roadmap</i> is an explicit, itemized, iterative process that guides investigators to prespecify study design and analysis plans; it addresses a wide range of guidance within a single framework. By supporting the transparent evaluation of causal assumptions and facilitating objective comparisons of design and analysis choices based on prespecified criteria, the <i>Roadmap</i> can help investigators to evaluate the quality of evidence that a given study is likely to produce, specify a study to generate high-quality RWE, and communicate effectively with regulatory agencies and other stakeholders. This paper aims to disseminate and extend the <i>Causal Roadmap</i> framework for use by clinical and translational researchers; three companion papers demonstrate applications of the <i>Causal Roadmap</i> for specific use cases."
Assessment of Neuroanatomical Endophenotypes of Autism Spectrum Disorder and Association With Characteristics of Individuals With Schizophrenia and the General Population.,37017948,Christos Davatzikos,University of Pennsylvania,AI 2 D Center for Data Science for Integrated Diagnostics,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with significant clinical, neuroanatomical, and genetic heterogeneity that limits precision diagnostics and treatment. To assess distinct neuroanatomical dimensions of ASD using novel semisupervised machine learning methods and to test whether the dimensions can serve as endophenotypes also in non-ASD populations. This cross-sectional study used imaging data from the publicly available Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) repositories as the discovery cohort. The ABIDE sample included individuals diagnosed with ASD aged between 16 and 64 years and age- and sex-match typically developing individuals. Validation cohorts included individuals with schizophrenia from the Psychosis Heterogeneity Evaluated via Dimensional Neuroimaging (PHENOM) consortium and individuals from the UK Biobank to represent the general population. The multisite discovery cohort included 16 internationally distributed imaging sites. Analyses were performed between March 2021 and March 2022. The trained semisupervised heterogeneity through discriminative analysis models were tested for reproducibility using extensive cross-validations. It was then applied to individuals from the PHENOM and the UK Biobank. It was hypothesized that neuroanatomical dimensions of ASD would display distinct clinical and genetic profiles and would be prominent also in non-ASD populations. Heterogeneity through discriminative analysis models trained on T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance images of 307 individuals with ASD (mean [SD] age, 25.4 [9.8] years; 273 [88.9%] male) and 362 typically developing control individuals (mean [SD] age, 25.8 [8.9] years; 309 [85.4%] male) revealed that a 3-dimensional scheme was optimal to capture the ASD neuroanatomy. The first dimension (A1: aginglike) was associated with smaller brain volume, lower cognitive function, and aging-related genetic variants (FOXO3; Z = 4.65; P = 1.62 × 10-6). The second dimension (A2: schizophrenialike) was characterized by enlarged subcortical volumes, antipsychotic medication use (Cohen d = 0.65; false discovery rate-adjusted P = .048), partially overlapping genetic, neuroanatomical characteristics to schizophrenia (n = 307), and significant genetic heritability estimates in the general population (n = 14 786; mean [SD] h2, 0.71 [0.04]; P < 1 × 10-4). The third dimension (A3: typical ASD) was distinguished by enlarged cortical volumes, high nonverbal cognitive performance, and biological pathways implicating brain development and abnormal apoptosis (mean [SD] β, 0.83 [0.02]; P = 4.22 × 10-6). This cross-sectional study discovered 3-dimensional endophenotypic representation that may elucidate the heterogeneous neurobiological underpinnings of ASD to support precision diagnostics. The significant correspondence between A2 and schizophrenia indicates a possibility of identifying common biological mechanisms across the 2 mental health diagnoses."
Classification of Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease Using Manual Motor Measures.,38865972,Kevin Duff,Oregon Health & Science University,Department of Neurology,"Manual motor problems have been reported in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the specific aspects that are affected, their neuropathology, and potential value for classification modeling is unknown. The current study examined if multiple measures of motor strength, dexterity, and speed are affected in MCI and AD, related to AD biomarkers, and are able to classify MCI or AD. Fifty-three cognitively normal (CN), 33 amnestic MCI, and 28 AD subjects completed five manual motor measures: grip force, Trail Making Test A, spiral tracing, finger tapping, and a simulated feeding task. Analyses included (1) group differences in manual performance; (2) associations between manual function and AD biomarkers (PET amyloid β, hippocampal volume, and APOE ε4 alleles); and (3) group classification accuracy of manual motor function using machine learning. Amnestic MCI and AD subjects exhibited slower psychomotor speed and AD subjects had weaker dominant hand grip strength than CN subjects. Performance on these measures was related to amyloid β deposition (both) and hippocampal volume (psychomotor speed only). Support vector classification well-discriminated control and AD subjects (area under the curve of 0.73 and 0.77, respectively) but poorly discriminated MCI from controls or AD. Grip strength and spiral tracing appear preserved, while psychomotor speed is affected in amnestic MCI and AD. The association of motor performance with amyloid β deposition and atrophy could indicate that this is due to amyloid deposition in and atrophy of motor brain regions, which generally occurs later in the disease process. The promising discriminatory abilities of manual motor measures for AD emphasize their value alongside other cognitive and motor assessment outcomes in classification and prediction models, as well as potential enrichment of outcome variables in AD clinical trials."
AmyloidPETNet: Classification of Amyloid Positivity in Brain PET Imaging Using End-to-End Deep Learning.,38860897,Aristeidis Sotiras,Rice University,From the Department of Bioengineering,"Background Visual assessment of amyloid PET scans relies on the availability of radiologist expertise, whereas quantification of amyloid burden typically involves MRI for processing and analysis, which can be computationally expensive. Purpose To develop a deep learning model to classify minimally processed brain PET scans as amyloid positive or negative, evaluate its performance on independent data sets and different tracers, and compare it with human visual reads. Materials and Methods This retrospective study used 8476 PET scans (6722 patients) obtained from late 2004 to early 2023 that were analyzed across five different data sets. A deep learning model, AmyloidPETNet, was trained on 1538 scans from 766 patients, validated on 205 scans from 95 patients, and internally tested on 184 scans from 95 patients in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) fluorine 18 (<sup>18</sup>F) florbetapir (FBP) data set. It was tested on ADNI scans using different tracers and scans from independent data sets. Scan amyloid positivity was based on mean cortical standardized uptake value ratio cutoffs. To compare with model performance, each scan from both the Centiloid Project and a subset of the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (A4) study were visually interpreted with a confidence level (low, intermediate, high) of amyloid positivity/negativity. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and other performance metrics were calculated, and Cohen κ was used to measure physician-model agreement. Results The model achieved an AUC of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.95, 0.99) on test ADNI <sup>18</sup>F-FBP scans, which generalized well to <sup>18</sup>F-FBP scans from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (AUC, 0.95; 95% CI: 0.93, 0.97) and the A4 study (AUC, 0.98; 95% CI: 0.98, 0.98). Model performance was high when applied to data sets with different tracers (AUC ≥ 0.97). Other performance metrics provided converging evidence. Physician-model agreement ranged from fair (Cohen κ = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.16, 0.60) on a sample of mostly equivocal cases from the A4 study to almost perfect (Cohen κ = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.86, 1.0) on the Centiloid Project. Conclusion The developed model was capable of automatically and accurately classifying brain PET scans as amyloid positive or negative without relying on experienced readers or requiring structural MRI.

Brain Disorder Detection and Diagnosis using Machine Learning and Deep Learning - A Bibliometric Analysis.,38847379,Gopikrishna Deshpande,Auburn University,Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering,"Brain disorders are one of the major global mortality issues, and their early detection is crucial for healing. Machine learning, specifically deep learning, is a technology that is increasingly being used to detect and diagnose brain disorders. Our objective is to provide a quantitative bibliometric analysis of the field to inform researchers about trends that can inform their Research directions in the future. We carried out a bibliometric analysis to create an overview of brain disorder detection and diagnosis using machine learning and deep learning. Our bibliometric analysis includes 1550 articles gathered from the Scopus database on automated brain disorder detection and diagnosis using machine learning and deep learning published from 2015 to May 2023. A thorough bibliometric análisis is carried out with the help of Biblioshiny and the VOSviewer platform. Citation analysis and various measures of collaboration are analyzed in the study. According to a study, maximum research is reported in 2022, with a consistent rise from preceding years. The majority of the authors referenced have concentrated on multiclass classification and innovative convolutional neural network models that are effective in this field. A keyword analysis revealed that among the several brain disorder types, Alzheimer's, autism, and Parkinson's disease had received the greatest attention. In terms of both authors and institutes, the USA, China, and India are among the most collaborating countries. We built a future research agenda based on our findings to help progress research on machine learning and deep learning for brain disorder detection and diagnosis. In summary, our quantitative bibliometric analysis provides useful insights about trends in the field and points them to potential directions in applying machine learning and deep learning for brain disorder detection and diagnosis.</P>."
Seeing beyond the symptoms: biomarkers and brain regions linked to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.,38813532,Abbas Babajani-Feremi,University of Florida,Department of Neurology,"Early Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis remains challenging, necessitating specific biomarkers for timely detection. This study aimed to identify such biomarkers and explore their associations with cognitive decline. A cohort of 1759 individuals across cognitive aging stages, including healthy controls (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD, was examined. Utilizing nine biomarkers from structural MRI (sMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and positron emission tomography (PET), predictions were made for Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDRSB), and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS). Biomarkers included four sMRI (e.g., average thickness [ATH]), four DTI (e.g., mean diffusivity [MD]), and one PET Amyloid-β (Aβ) measure. Ensemble regression tree (ERT) technique with bagging and random forest approaches were applied in four groups (HC/MCI, HC/AD, MCI/AD, and HC/MCI/AD). Aβ emerged as a robust predictor of cognitive scores, particularly in late-stage AD. Volumetric measures, notably ATH, consistently correlated with cognitive scores across early and late disease stages. Additionally, ADAS demonstrated links to various neuroimaging biomarkers in all subject groups, highlighting its efficacy in monitoring brain changes throughout disease progression. ERT identified key brain regions associated with cognitive scores, such as the right transverse temporal region for Aβ, left and right entorhinal cortex, left inferior temporal gyrus, and left middle temporal gyrus for ATH, and the left uncinate fasciculus for MD. This study underscores the importance of an interdisciplinary approach in understanding AD mechanisms, offering potential contributions to early biomarker development."
A Review of Artificial Intelligence in Breast Imaging.,38787015,Mohammed H Ahmed,Coventry University,School of Computing,"With the increasing dominance of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, the important prospects for their application have extended to various medical fields, including domains such as in vitro diagnosis, intelligent rehabilitation, medical imaging, and prognosis. Breast cancer is a common malignancy that critically affects women's physical and mental health. Early breast cancer screening-through mammography, ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-can substantially improve the prognosis for breast cancer patients. AI applications have shown excellent performance in various image recognition tasks, and their use in breast cancer screening has been explored in numerous studies. This paper introduces relevant AI techniques and their applications in the field of medical imaging of the breast (mammography and ultrasound), specifically in terms of identifying, segmenting, and classifying lesions; assessing breast cancer risk; and improving image quality. Focusing on medical imaging for breast cancer, this paper also reviews related challenges and prospects for AI."
Using a comprehensive atlas and predictive models to reveal the complexity and evolution of brain-active regulatory elements.,38781344,Zhiping Weng,University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School,Department of Genomics and Computational Biology,"Most genetic variants associated with psychiatric disorders are located in noncoding regions of the genome. To investigate their functional implications, we integrate epigenetic data from the PsychENCODE Consortium and other published sources to construct a comprehensive atlas of candidate brain cis-regulatory elements. Using deep learning, we model these elements' sequence syntax and predict how binding sites for lineage-specific transcription factors contribute to cell type-specific gene regulation in various types of glia and neurons. The elements' evolutionary history suggests that new regulatory information in the brain emerges primarily via smaller sequence mutations within conserved mammalian elements rather than entirely new human- or primate-specific sequences. However, primate-specific candidate elements, particularly those active during fetal brain development and in excitatory neurons and astrocytes, are implicated in the heritability of brain-related human traits. Additionally, we introduce PsychSCREEN, a web-based platform offering interactive visualization of PsychENCODE-generated genetic and epigenetic data from diverse brain cell types in individuals with psychiatric disorders and healthy controls."
High-Order line graphs of fMRI data in major depressive disorder.,38767470,Yao Li,Taiyuan University of Technology,School of Software,"Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) technology and the complex network theory can be used to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of brain diseases. The successful application of functional brain hypernetworks provides new perspectives for the diagnosis and evaluation of clinical brain diseases; however, many studies have not assessed the attribute information of hyperedges and could not retain the high-order topology of hypergraphs. In addition, the study of multi-scale and multi-layered organizational properties of the human brain can provide richer and more accurate data features for classification models of depression. This work aims to establish a more accurate classification framework for the diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) using the high-order line graph algorithm. And accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F<sub>1</sub> score are used to validate its classification performance. Based on rs-fMRI data from 38 MDD subjects and 28 controls, we constructed a human brain hypernetwork and introduced a line graph model, followed by the construction of a high-order line graph model. The topological properties under each order line graph were calculated to measure the classification performance of the model. Finally, intergroup features that showed significant differences under each order line graph model were fused, and a support vector machine classifier was constructed using multi-kernel learning. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov nonparametric permutation test was used as the feature selection method and the classification performance was measured with the leave-one-out cross-validation method. The high-order line graph achieved a better classification performance compared with other traditional hypernetworks (accuracy = 92.42%, sensitivity = 92.86%, specificity = 92.11%, precision = 89.66%, F<sub>1 </sub>= 91.23%). Furthermore, the brain regions found in the present study have been previously shown to be associated with the pathology of depression. This work validated the classification model based on the high-order line graph, which can better express the topological features of the hypernetwork by comprehensively considering the hyperedge information under different connection strengths, thereby significantly improving the classification accuracy of MDD. Therefore, this method has potential for use in the clinical diagnosis of MDD."
AlphaFold2 structures guide prospective ligand discovery.,38753765,Bryan L Roth,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine,Department of Pharmacology,"AlphaFold2 (AF2) models have had wide impact but mixed success in retrospective ligand recognition. We prospectively docked large libraries against unrefined AF2 models of the σ<sub>2</sub> and serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptors, testing hundreds of new molecules and comparing results with those obtained from docking against the experimental structures. Hit rates were high and similar for the experimental and AF2 structures, as were affinities. Success in docking against the AF2 models was achieved despite differences between orthosteric residue conformations in the AF2 models and the experimental structures. Determination of the cryo-electron microscopy structure for one of the more potent 5-HT2A ligands from the AF2 docking revealed residue accommodations that resembled the AF2 prediction. AF2 models may sample conformations that differ from experimental structures but remain low energy and relevant for ligand discovery, extending the domain of structure-based drug design."
Intensive longitudinal assessment following index trauma to predict development of PTSD using machine learning.,38723405,Srijan Sen,University of Michigan,Department of Psychiatry,"There are significant challenges to identifying which individuals require intervention following exposure to trauma, and a need for strategies to identify and provide individuals at risk for developing PTSD with timely interventions. The present study seeks to identify a minimal set of trauma-related symptoms, assessed during the weeks following traumatic exposure, that can accurately predict PTSD. Participants were 2185 adults (Mean age=36.4 years; 64% women; 50% Black) presenting for emergency care following traumatic exposure. Participants received a 'flash survey' with 6-8 varying symptoms (from a pool of 26 trauma symptoms) several times per week for eight weeks following the trauma exposure (each symptom assessed ∼6 times). Features (mean, sd, last, worst, peak-end scores) from the repeatedly assessed symptoms were included as candidate variables in a CART machine learning analysis to develop a pragmatic predictive algorithm. PTSD (PCL-5 ≥38) was present for 669 (31%) participants at the 8-week follow-up. A classification tree with three splits, based on mean scores of nervousness, rehashing, and fatigue, predicted PTSD with an Area Under the Curve of 0.836. Findings suggest feasibility for a 3-item assessment protocol, delivered once per week, following traumatic exposure to assess and potentially facilitate follow-up care for those at risk."

Strong Association of Depression and Anxiety With the Presence of Back Pain While Impact of Spinal Imaging Findings is Limited: Analysis of an MRI Cohort Study.,37742905,Sophia Stoecklein,University Hospital,Department of Radiology,"Development of back pain is multifactorial, and it is not well understood which factors are the main drivers of the disease. We therefore applied a machine-learning approach to an existing large cohort study data set and sought to identify and rank the most important contributors to the presence of back pain amongst the documented parameters of the cohort. Data from 399 participants in the KORA-MRI (Cooperative health research in the region Augsburg-magnetic resonance imaging) (Cooperative Health Research in the Region Augsburg) study was analyzed. The data set included MRI images of the whole body, including the spine, metabolic, sociodemographic, anthropometric, and cardiovascular data. The presence of back pain was one of the documented items in this data set. Applying a machine-learning approach to this preexisting data set, we sought to identify the variables that were most strongly associated with back pain. Mediation analysis was performed to evaluate the underlying mechanisms of the identified associations. We found that depression and anxiety were the 2 most selected predictors for back pain in our model. Additionally, body mass index, spinal canal width and disc generation, medium and heavy physical work as well as cardiovascular factors were among the top 10 most selected predictors. Using mediation analysis, we found that the effects of anxiety and depression on the presence of back pain were mainly direct effects that were not mediated by spinal imaging. In summary, we found that psychological factors were the most important predictors of back pain in our cohort. This supports the notion that back pain should be treated in a personalized multidimensional framework. PERSPECTIVE: This article presents a wholistic approach to the problem of back pain. We found that depression and anxiety were the top predictors of back pain in our cohort. This strengthens the case for a multidimensional treatment approach to back pain, possibly with a special emphasis on psychological factors."
Population modeling with machine learning can enhance measures of mental health - Open-data replication.,40568461,Janine Bijsterbosch,Washington University School of Medicine,Department of Radiology,"Efforts to predict trait phenotypes based on functional MRI data from large cohorts have been hampered by low prediction accuracy and/or small effect sizes. Although these findings are highly replicable, the small effect sizes are somewhat surprising given the presumed brain basis of phenotypic traits such as neuroticism and fluid intelligence. We aim to replicate previous work and additionally test multiple data manipulations that may improve prediction accuracy by addressing data pollution challenges. Specifically, we added additional fMRI features, averaged the target phenotype across multiple measurements to obtain more accurate estimates of the underlying trait, balanced the target phenotype's distribution through undersampling of majority scores, and identified data-driven subtypes to investigate the impact of between-participant heterogeneity. Our results replicated prior results from Dadi et al. (2021) in a larger sample. Each data manipulation further led to small but consistent improvements in prediction accuracy, which were largely additive when combining multiple data manipulations. Combining data manipulations (i.e., extended fMRI features, averaged target phenotype, balanced target phenotype distribution) led to a three-fold increase in prediction accuracy for fluid intelligence compared to prior work. These findings highlight the benefit of several relatively easy and low-cost data manipulations, which may positively impact future work."
The coming decade of digital brain research: A vision for neuroscience at the intersection of technology and computing.,40800542,Laszlo Zaborszky,Rutgers University,Center of Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience,"In recent years, brain research has indisputably entered a new epoch, driven by substantial methodological advances and digitally enabled data integration and modelling at multiple scales-from molecules to the whole brain. Major advances are emerging at the intersection of neuroscience with technology and computing. This new science of the brain combines high-quality research, data integration across multiple scales, a new culture of multidisciplinary large-scale collaboration, and translation into applications. As pioneered in Europe's Human Brain Project (HBP), a systematic approach will be essential for meeting the coming decade's pressing medical and technological challenges. The aims of this paper are to: develop a concept for the coming decade of digital brain research, discuss this new concept with the research community at large, identify points of convergence, and derive therefrom scientific common goals; provide a scientific framework for the current and future development of EBRAINS, a research infrastructure resulting from the HBP's work; inform and engage stakeholders, funding organisations and research institutions regarding future digital brain research; identify and address the transformational potential of comprehensive brain models for artificial intelligence, including machine learning and deep learning; outline a collaborative approach that integrates reflection, dialogues, and societal engagement on ethical and societal opportunities and challenges as part of future neuroscience research."
Acoustic and Text Features Analysis for Adult ADHD Screening: A Data-Driven Approach Utilizing DIVA Interview.,38606391,Syed Mohsen Naqvi,School of EngineeringNewcastle University NE1 7RU Newcastle Upon Tyne U.K.,School of EngineeringNewcastle University NE1 7RU Newcastle Upon Tyne U.K.,"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder commonly seen in childhood that leads to behavioural changes in social development and communication patterns, often continues into undiagnosed adulthood due to a global shortage of psychiatrists, resulting in delayed diagnoses with lasting consequences on individual's well-being and the societal impact. Recently, machine learning methodologies have been incorporated into healthcare systems to facilitate the diagnosis and enhance the potential prediction of treatment outcomes for mental health conditions. In ADHD detection, the previous research focused on utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or Electroencephalography (EEG) signals, which require costly equipment and trained personnel for data collection. In recent years, speech and text modalities have garnered increasing attention due to their cost-effectiveness and non-wearable sensing in data collection. In this research, conducted in collaboration with the Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust, we gathered audio data from both ADHD patients and normal controls based on the clinically popular Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in adults (DIVA). Subsequently, we transformed the speech data into text modalities through the utilization of the Google Cloud Speech API. We extracted both acoustic and text features from the data, encompassing traditional acoustic features (e.g., MFCC), specialized feature sets (e.g., eGeMAPS), as well as deep-learned linguistic and semantic features derived from pre-trained deep learning models. These features are employed in conjunction with a support vector machine for ADHD classification, yielding promising outcomes in the utilization of audio and text data for effective adult ADHD screening. Clinical impact: This research introduces a transformative approach in ADHD diagnosis, employing speech and text analysis to facilitate early and more accessible detection, particularly beneficial in areas with limited psychiatric resources. Clinical and Translational Impact Statement: The successful application of machine learning techniques in analyzing audio and text data for ADHD screening represents a significant advancement in mental health diagnostics, paving the way for its integration into clinical settings and potentially improving patient outcomes on a broader scale."
Voxelwise Multivariate Analysis of Brain-Psychosocial Associations in Adolescents Reveals 6 Latent Dimensions of Cognition and Psychopathology.,38588854,Janaina Mourão-Miranda,University College London,Department of Computer Science,"Adolescence heralds the onset of considerable psychopathology, which may be conceptualized as an emergence of altered covariation between symptoms and brain measures. Multivariate methods can detect such modes of covariation or latent dimensions, but none specifically relating to psychopathology have yet been found using population-level structural brain data. Using voxelwise (instead of parcellated) brain data may strengthen latent dimensions' brain-psychosocial relationships, but this creates computational challenges. We obtained voxelwise gray matter density and psychosocial variables from the baseline (ages 9-10 years) Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study cohort (N = 11,288) and employed a state-of-the-art segmentation method, sparse partial least squares, and a rigorous machine learning framework to prevent overfitting. We found 6 latent dimensions, 4 of which pertain specifically to mental health. The mental health dimensions were related to overeating, anorexia/internalizing, oppositional symptoms (all ps < .002) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms (p = .03). Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was related to increased and internalizing symptoms related to decreased gray matter density in dopaminergic and serotonergic midbrain areas, whereas oppositional symptoms were related to increased gray matter in a noradrenergic nucleus. Internalizing symptoms were related to increased and oppositional symptoms to reduced gray matter density in the insular, cingulate, and auditory cortices. Striatal regions featured strongly, with reduced caudate nucleus gray matter in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and reduced putamen gray matter in oppositional/conduct problems. Voxelwise gray matter density generated stronger brain-psychosocial correlations than brain parcellations. Voxelwise brain data strengthen latent dimensions of brain-psychosocial covariation, and sparse multivariate methods increase their psychopathological specificity. Internalizing and externalizing symptoms are associated with opposite gray matter changes in similar cortical and subcortical areas."
Examining factors related to low performance of predicting remission in participants with major depressive disorder using neuroimaging data and other clinical features.,38547128,Jie Yang,Stony Brook University,Department of Family,"Major depressive disorder (MDD), a prevalent mental health issue, affects more than 8% of the US population, and almost 17% in the young group of 18-25 years old. Since Covid-19, its prevalence has become even more significant. However, the remission (being free of depression) rates of first-line antidepressant treatments on MDD are only about 30%. To improve treatment outcomes, researchers have built various predictive models for treatment responses and yet none of them have been adopted in clinical use. One reason is that most predictive models are based on data from subjective questionnaires, which are less reliable. Neuroimaging data are promising objective prognostic factors, but they are expensive to obtain and hence predictive models using neuroimaging data are limited and such studies were usually in small scale (N<100). In this paper, we proposed an advanced machine learning (ML) pipeline for small training dataset with large number of features. We implemented multiple imputation for missing data and repeated K-fold cross validation (CV) to robustly estimate predictive performances. Different feature selection methods and stacking methods using 6 general ML models including random forest, gradient boosting decision tree, XGBoost, penalized logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), and neural network were examined to evaluate the model performances. All predictive models were compared using model performance metrics such as accuracy, balanced accuracy, area under ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity. Our proposed ML pipeline was applied to a training dataset and obtained an accuracy and AUC above 0.80. But such high performance failed while applying our ML pipeline using an external validation dataset from the EMBARC study which is a multi-center study. We further examined the possible reasons especially the site heterogeneity issue."
Mechanisms underlying capsulotomy for refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder: neural correlates of negative affect processing overlap with deep brain stimulation targets.,36878966,Valerie Voon,University of Cambridge,Department of Psychiatry,"Ablative procedures such as anterior capsulotomy are potentially effective in refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Converging evidence suggests the ventral internal capsule white matter tracts traversing the rostral cingulate and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and thalamus is the optimal target for clinical efficacy across multiple deep brain stimulation targets for OCD. Here we ask which prefrontal regions and underlying cognitive processes might be implicated in the effects of capsulotomy by using both task fMRI and neuropsychological tests assessing OCD-relevant cognitive mechanisms known to map across prefrontal regions connected to the tracts targeted in capsulotomy. We tested OCD patients at least 6 months post-capsulotomy (n = 27), OCD controls (n = 33) and healthy controls (n = 34). We used a modified aversive monetary incentive delay paradigm with negative imagery and a within session extinction trial. Post-capsulotomy OCD subjects showed improved OCD symptoms, disability and quality of life with no differences in mood or anxiety or cognitive task performance on executive, inhibition, memory and learning tasks. Task fMRI revealed post-capsulotomy decreases in the nucleus accumbens during negative anticipation, and in the left rostral cingulate and left inferior frontal cortex during negative feedback. Post-capsulotomy patients showed attenuated accumbens-rostral cingulate functional connectivity. Rostral cingulate activity mediated capsulotomy improvement on obsessions. These regions overlap with optimal white matter tracts observed across multiple stimulation targets for OCD and might provide insights into further optimizing neuromodulation approaches. Our findings also suggest that aversive processing theoretical mechanisms may link ablative, stimulation and psychological interventions."
EF-Net: Mental State Recognition by Analyzing Multimodal EEG-fNIRS via CNN.,38544152,Ahmed Helmy,University of North Carolina,Department of Computer Science,"Analysis of brain signals is essential to the study of mental states and various neurological conditions. The two most prevalent noninvasive signals for measuring brain activities are electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). EEG, characterized by its higher sampling frequency, captures more temporal features, while fNIRS, with a greater number of channels, provides richer spatial information. Although a few previous studies have explored the use of multimodal deep-learning models to analyze brain activity for both EEG and fNIRS, <i>subject-independent</i> training-testing split analysis remains underexplored. The results of the subject-independent setting directly show the model's ability on unseen subjects, which is crucial for real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce <i>EF-Net</i>, a new CNN-based multimodal deep-learning model. We evaluate EF-Net on an EEG-fNIRS word generation (WG) dataset on the mental state recognition task, primarily focusing on the subject-independent setting. For completeness, we report results in the subject-dependent and subject-semidependent settings as well. We compare our model with five baseline approaches, including three traditional machine learning methods and two deep learning methods. EF-Net demonstrates superior performance in both accuracy and F1 score, surpassing these baselines. Our model achieves F1 scores of 99.36%, 98.31%, and 65.05% in the subject-dependent, subject-semidependent, and subject-independent settings, respectively, surpassing the best baseline F1 scores by 1.83%, 4.34%, and 2.13% These results highlight EF-Net's capability to effectively learn and interpret mental states and brain activity across different and unseen subjects."
Improving disease classification performance and explainability of deep learning models in radiology with heatmap generators.,37492678,Farzad Khalvati,The Hospital for Sick Children,Department of Diagnostic Imaging,"As deep learning is widely used in the radiology field, the explainability of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models is becoming increasingly essential to gain clinicians' trust when using the models for diagnosis. In this research, three experiment sets were conducted with a U-Net architecture to improve the disease classification performance while enhancing the heatmaps corresponding to the model's focus through incorporating heatmap generators during training. All experiments used the dataset that contained chest radiographs, associated labels from one of the three conditions [""normal"", ""congestive heart failure (CHF)"", and ""pneumonia""], and numerical information regarding a radiologist's eye-gaze coordinates on the images. The paper that introduced this dataset developed a U-Net model, which was treated as the baseline model for this research, to show how the eye-gaze data can be used in multi-modal training for explainability improvement and disease classification. To compare the classification performances among this research's three experiment sets and the baseline model, the 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were measured. The best method achieved an AUC of 0.913 with a 95% CI of [0.860, 0.966]. ""Pneumonia"" and ""CHF"" classes, which the baseline model struggled the most to classify, had the greatest improvements, resulting in AUCs of 0.859 with a 95% CI of [0.732, 0.957] and 0.962 with a 95% CI of [0.933, 0.989], respectively. The decoder of the U-Net for the best-performing proposed method generated heatmaps that highlight the determining image parts in model classifications. These predicted heatmaps, which can be used for the explainability of the model, also improved to align well with the radiologist's eye-gaze data. Hence, this work showed that incorporating heatmap generators and eye-gaze information into training can simultaneously improve disease classification and provide explainable visuals that align well with how the radiologist viewed the chest radiographs when making diagnosis."
Identification of group differences in predictive anticipatory biasing of pain during uncertainty: preparing for the worst but hoping for the best.,38501988,Alan N Simmons,San Diego Veterans Affairs Health Care Center,San Diego Veterans Affairs Health Care Center,"Pain anticipation during conditions of uncertainty can unveil intrinsic biases, and understanding these biases can guide pain treatment interventions. This study used machine learning and functional magnetic resonance imaging to predict anticipatory responses in a pain anticipation experiment. One hundred forty-seven participants that included healthy controls (n = 57) and individuals with current and/or past mental health diagnosis (n = 90) received cues indicating upcoming pain stimuli: 2 cues predicted high and low temperatures, while a third cue introduced uncertainty. Accurate differentiation of neural patterns associated with specific anticipatory conditions was observed, involving activation in the anterior short gyrus of the insula and the nucleus accumbens. Three distinct response profiles emerged: subjects with a negative bias towards high pain anticipation, those with a positive bias towards low pain anticipation, and individuals whose predictions during uncertainty were unbiased. These profiles remained stable over one year, were consistent across diagnosed psychopathologies, and correlated with cognitive coping styles and underlying insula anatomy. The findings suggest that individualized and stable pain anticipation occurs in uncertain conditions."
In the face of ambiguity: intrinsic brain organization in development predicts one's bias toward positivity or negativity.,38494885,Maital Neta,University of Nebraska-Lincoln,Department of Psychology,"Exacerbated negativity bias, including in responses to ambiguity, represents a common phenotype of internalizing disorders. Individuals differ in their propensity toward positive or negative appraisals of ambiguity. This variability constitutes one's valence bias, a stable construct linked to mental health. Evidence suggests an initial negativity in response to ambiguity that updates via regulatory processes to support a more positive bias. Previous work implicates the amygdala and prefrontal cortex, and regions of the cingulo-opercular system, in this regulatory process. Nonetheless, the neurodevelopmental origins of valence bias remain unclear. The current study tests whether intrinsic brain organization predicts valence bias among 119 children and adolescents (6 to 17 years). Using whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity, a machine-learning model predicted valence bias (r = 0.20, P = 0.03), as did a model restricted to amygdala and cingulo-opercular system features (r = 0.19, P = 0.04). Disrupting connectivity revealed additional intra-system (e.g. fronto-parietal) and inter-system (e.g. amygdala to cingulo-opercular) connectivity important for prediction. The results highlight top-down control systems and bottom-up perceptual processes that influence valence bias in development. Thus, intrinsic brain organization informs the neurodevelopmental origins of valence bias, and directs future work aimed at explicating related internalizing symptomology."
Aberrant brain network topology in youth with a familial risk for bipolar disorder: a task-based fMRI connectome study.,38220469,Melissa P DelBello,University of Cincinnati,Department of Psychiatry,"Youth with a family history of bipolar disorder (BD) may be at increased risk for mood disorders and for developing side effects after antidepressant exposure. The neurobiological basis of these risks remains poorly understood. We aimed to identify biomarkers underlying risk by characterizing abnormalities in the brain connectome of symptomatic youth at familial risk for BD. Depressed and/or anxious youth (n = 119, age = 14.9 ± 1.6 years) with a family history of BD but no prior antidepressant exposure and typically developing controls (n = 57, age = 14.8 ± 1.7 years) received functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an emotional continuous performance task. A generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) analysis was performed to compare their brain connectome patterns, followed by machine learning of topological metrics. High-risk youth showed weaker connectivity patterns that were mainly located in the default mode network (DMN) (network weight = 50.1%) relative to controls, and connectivity patterns derived from the visual network (VN) constituted the largest proportion of aberrant stronger pairs (network weight = 54.9%). Global local efficiency (E<sub>local</sub>, p = .022) and clustering coefficient (C<sub>p</sub>, p = .029) and nodal metrics of the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG) (E<sub>local</sub>: p < .001; C<sub>p</sub>: p = .001) in the high-risk group were significantly higher than those in healthy subjects, and similar patterns were also found in the left insula (degree: p = .004; betweenness: p = .005; age-by-group interaction, p = .038) and right hippocampus (degree: p = .003; betweenness: p = .003). The case-control classifier achieved a cross-validation accuracy of 78.4%. Our findings of abnormal connectome organization in the DMN and VN may advance mechanistic understanding of risk for BD. Neuroimaging biomarkers of increased network segregation in the SFG and altered topological centrality in the insula and hippocampus in broader limbic systems may be used to target interventions tailored to mitigate the underlying risk of brain abnormalities in these at-risk youth."
Addressing multi-site functional MRI heterogeneity through dual-expert collaborative learning for brain disease identification.,37227019,Mingxia Liu,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,Department of Radiology and BRIC,"Several studies employ multi-site rs-fMRI data for major depressive disorder (MDD) identification, with a specific site as the to-be-analyzed target domain and other site(s) as the source domain. But they usually suffer from significant inter-site heterogeneity caused by the use of different scanners and/or scanning protocols and fail to build generalizable models that can well adapt to multiple target domains. In this article, we propose a dual-expert fMRI harmonization (DFH) framework for automated MDD diagnosis. Our DFH is designed to simultaneously exploit data from a single labeled source domain/site and two unlabeled target domains for mitigating data distribution differences across domains. Specifically, the DFH consists of a domain-generic student model and two domain-specific teacher/expert models that are jointly trained to perform knowledge distillation through a deep collaborative learning module. A student model with strong generalizability is finally derived, which can be well adapted to unseen target domains and analysis of other brain diseases. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first attempts to investigate multi-target fMRI harmonization for MDD diagnosis. Comprehensive experiments on 836 subjects with rs-fMRI data from 3 different sites show the superiority of our method. The discriminative brain functional connectivities identified by our method could be regarded as potential biomarkers for fMRI-related MDD diagnosis."
Assessment of Neuroanatomical Endophenotypes of Autism Spectrum Disorder and Association With Characteristics of Individuals With Schizophrenia and the General Population.,37017948,Christos Davatzikos,University of Pennsylvania,AI 2 D Center for Data Science for Integrated Diagnostics,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with significant clinical, neuroanatomical, and genetic heterogeneity that limits precision diagnostics and treatment. To assess distinct neuroanatomical dimensions of ASD using novel semisupervised machine learning methods and to test whether the dimensions can serve as endophenotypes also in non-ASD populations. This cross-sectional study used imaging data from the publicly available Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) repositories as the discovery cohort. The ABIDE sample included individuals diagnosed with ASD aged between 16 and 64 years and age- and sex-match typically developing individuals. Validation cohorts included individuals with schizophrenia from the Psychosis Heterogeneity Evaluated via Dimensional Neuroimaging (PHENOM) consortium and individuals from the UK Biobank to represent the general population. The multisite discovery cohort included 16 internationally distributed imaging sites. Analyses were performed between March 2021 and March 2022. The trained semisupervised heterogeneity through discriminative analysis models were tested for reproducibility using extensive cross-validations. It was then applied to individuals from the PHENOM and the UK Biobank. It was hypothesized that neuroanatomical dimensions of ASD would display distinct clinical and genetic profiles and would be prominent also in non-ASD populations. Heterogeneity through discriminative analysis models trained on T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance images of 307 individuals with ASD (mean [SD] age, 25.4 [9.8] years; 273 [88.9%] male) and 362 typically developing control individuals (mean [SD] age, 25.8 [8.9] years; 309 [85.4%] male) revealed that a 3-dimensional scheme was optimal to capture the ASD neuroanatomy. The first dimension (A1: aginglike) was associated with smaller brain volume, lower cognitive function, and aging-related genetic variants (FOXO3; Z = 4.65; P = 1.62 × 10-6). The second dimension (A2: schizophrenialike) was characterized by enlarged subcortical volumes, antipsychotic medication use (Cohen d = 0.65; false discovery rate-adjusted P = .048), partially overlapping genetic, neuroanatomical characteristics to schizophrenia (n = 307), and significant genetic heritability estimates in the general population (n = 14 786; mean [SD] h2, 0.71 [0.04]; P < 1 × 10-4). The third dimension (A3: typical ASD) was distinguished by enlarged cortical volumes, high nonverbal cognitive performance, and biological pathways implicating brain development and abnormal apoptosis (mean [SD] β, 0.83 [0.02]; P = 4.22 × 10-6). This cross-sectional study discovered 3-dimensional endophenotypic representation that may elucidate the heterogeneous neurobiological underpinnings of ASD to support precision diagnostics. The significant correspondence between A2 and schizophrenia indicates a possibility of identifying common biological mechanisms across the 2 mental health diagnoses."

Early inner plexiform layer thinning and retinal nerve fiber layer thickening in excitotoxic retinal injury using deep learning-assisted optical coherence tomography.,38303097,Kevin C Chan,New York University,Department of Ophthalmology,"Excitotoxicity from the impairment of glutamate uptake constitutes an important mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. Within the eye, excitotoxicity is thought to play a critical role in retinal ganglion cell death in glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, retinal ischemia, and optic nerve injury, yet how excitotoxic injury impacts different retinal layers is not well understood. Here, we investigated the longitudinal effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxic retinal injury in a rat model using deep learning-assisted retinal layer thickness estimation. Before and after unilateral intravitreal NMDA injection in nine adult Long Evans rats, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) was used to acquire volumetric retinal images in both eyes over 4 weeks. Ten retinal layers were automatically segmented from the OCT data using our deep learning-based algorithm. Retinal degeneration was evaluated using layer-specific retinal thickness changes at each time point (before, and at 3, 7, and 28 days after NMDA injection). Within the inner retina, our OCT results showed that retinal thinning occurred first in the inner plexiform layer at 3 days after NMDA injection, followed by the inner nuclear layer at 7 days post-injury. In contrast, the retinal nerve fiber layer exhibited an initial thickening 3 days after NMDA injection, followed by normalization and thinning up to 4 weeks post-injury. Our results demonstrated the pathological cascades of NMDA-induced neurotoxicity across different layers of the retina. The early inner plexiform layer thinning suggests early dendritic shrinkage, whereas the initial retinal nerve fiber layer thickening before subsequent normalization and thinning indicates early inflammation before axonal loss and cell death. These findings implicate the inner plexiform layer as an early imaging biomarker of excitotoxic retinal degeneration, whereas caution is warranted when interpreting the ganglion cell complex combining retinal nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell layer, and inner plexiform layer thicknesses in conventional OCT measures. Deep learning-assisted retinal layer segmentation and longitudinal OCT monitoring can help evaluate the different phases of retinal layer damage upon excitotoxicity."
An ASER AI/ML expert panel formative user research study for an interpretable interactive splenic AAST grading graphical user interface prototype.,38302827,David Dreizin,University of Maryland School of Medicine,University of Maryland School of Medicine,"The AAST Organ Injury Scale is widely adopted for splenic injury severity but suffers from only moderate inter-rater agreement. This work assesses SpleenPro, a prototype interactive explainable artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) diagnostic aid to support AAST grading, for effects on radiologist dwell time, agreement, clinical utility, and user acceptance. Two trauma radiology ad hoc expert panelists independently performed timed AAST grading on 76 admission CT studies with blunt splenic injury, first without AI/ML assistance, and after a 2-month washout period and randomization, with AI/ML assistance. To evaluate user acceptance, three versions of the SpleenPro user interface with increasing explainability were presented to four independent expert panelists with four example cases each. A structured interview consisting of Likert scales and free responses was conducted, with specific questions regarding dimensions of diagnostic utility (DU); mental support (MS); effort, workload, and frustration (EWF); trust and reliability (TR); and likelihood of future use (LFU). SpleenPro significantly decreased interpretation times for both raters. Weighted Cohen's kappa increased from 0.53 to 0.70 with AI/ML assistance. During user acceptance interviews, increasing explainability was associated with improvement in Likert scores for MS, EWF, TR, and LFU. Expert panelists indicated the need for a combined early notification and grading functionality, PACS integration, and report autopopulation to improve DU. SpleenPro was useful for improving objectivity of AAST grading and increasing mental support. Formative user research identified generalizable concepts including the need for a combined detection and grading pipeline and integration with the clinical workflow."
Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis using optical coherence tomography supported by explainable artificial intelligence.,38297153,E Garcia-Martin,Miguel Servet University Hospital,Department of Ophthalmology,"Study of retinal structure based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) data can facilitate early diagnosis of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Although artificial intelligence can provide highly reliable diagnoses, the results obtained must be explainable. The study included 79 recently diagnosed RRMS patients and 69 age matched healthy control subjects. Thickness (Avg) and inter-eye difference (Diff) features are obtained in 4 retinal layers using the posterior pole protocol. Each layer is divided into six analysis zones. The Support Vector Machine plus Recursive Feature Elimination with Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (SVM-RFE-LOOCV) approach is used to find the subset of features that reduces dimensionality and optimises the performance of the classifier. SVM-RFE-LOOCV was used to identify OCT features with greatest capacity for early diagnosis, determining the area of the papillomacular bundle to be the most influential. A correlation was observed between loss of layer thickness and increase in functional disability. There was also greater functional deterioration in patients with greater asymmetry between left and right eyes. The classifier based on the top-ranked features obtained sensitivity = 0.86 and specificity = 0.90. There was consistency between the features identified as relevant by the SVM-RFE-LOOCV approach and the retinotopic distribution of the retinal nerve fibres and the optic nerve head. This simple method contributes to implementation of an assisted diagnosis system and its accuracy exceeds that achieved with magnetic resonance imaging of the central nervous system, the current gold standard. This paper provides novel insights into RRMS affectation of the neuroretina."
Neuroimaging standards for research into small vessel disease-advances since 2013.,37236211,Joanna M Wardlaw,University of Edinburgh,N/A,"Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is common during ageing and can present as stroke, cognitive decline, neurobehavioural symptoms, or functional impairment. SVD frequently coexists with neurodegenerative disease, and can exacerbate cognitive and other symptoms and affect activities of daily living. Standards for Reporting Vascular Changes on Neuroimaging 1 (STRIVE-1) categorised and standardised the diverse features of SVD that are visible on structural MRI. Since then, new information on these established SVD markers and novel MRI sequences and imaging features have emerged. As the effect of combined SVD imaging features becomes clearer, a key role for quantitative imaging biomarkers to determine sub-visible tissue damage, subtle abnormalities visible at high-field strength MRI, and lesion-symptom patterns, is also apparent. Together with rapidly emerging machine learning methods, these metrics can more comprehensively capture the effect of SVD on the brain than the structural MRI features alone and serve as intermediary outcomes in clinical trials and future routine practice. Using a similar approach to that adopted in STRIVE-1, we updated the guidance on neuroimaging of vascular changes in studies of ageing and neurodegeneration to create STRIVE-2."
Aberrant brain network topology in youth with a familial risk for bipolar disorder: a task-based fMRI connectome study.,38220469,Melissa P DelBello,University of Cincinnati,Department of Psychiatry,"Youth with a family history of bipolar disorder (BD) may be at increased risk for mood disorders and for developing side effects after antidepressant exposure. The neurobiological basis of these risks remains poorly understood. We aimed to identify biomarkers underlying risk by characterizing abnormalities in the brain connectome of symptomatic youth at familial risk for BD. Depressed and/or anxious youth (n = 119, age = 14.9 ± 1.6 years) with a family history of BD but no prior antidepressant exposure and typically developing controls (n = 57, age = 14.8 ± 1.7 years) received functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an emotional continuous performance task. A generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) analysis was performed to compare their brain connectome patterns, followed by machine learning of topological metrics. High-risk youth showed weaker connectivity patterns that were mainly located in the default mode network (DMN) (network weight = 50.1%) relative to controls, and connectivity patterns derived from the visual network (VN) constituted the largest proportion of aberrant stronger pairs (network weight = 54.9%). Global local efficiency (E<sub>local</sub>, p = .022) and clustering coefficient (C<sub>p</sub>, p = .029) and nodal metrics of the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG) (E<sub>local</sub>: p < .001; C<sub>p</sub>: p = .001) in the high-risk group were significantly higher than those in healthy subjects, and similar patterns were also found in the left insula (degree: p = .004; betweenness: p = .005; age-by-group interaction, p = .038) and right hippocampus (degree: p = .003; betweenness: p = .003). The case-control classifier achieved a cross-validation accuracy of 78.4%. Our findings of abnormal connectome organization in the DMN and VN may advance mechanistic understanding of risk for BD. Neuroimaging biomarkers of increased network segregation in the SFG and altered topological centrality in the insula and hippocampus in broader limbic systems may be used to target interventions tailored to mitigate the underlying risk of brain abnormalities in these at-risk youth."
Brain morphometric features predict depression symptom phenotypes in late-life depression using a deep learning model.,37539384,Guy G Potter,Duke University Medical Center,Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences,"Our objective was to use deep learning models to identify underlying brain regions associated with depression symptom phenotypes in late-life depression (LLD). Diagnosed with LLD (<i>N</i> = 116) and enrolled in a prospective treatment study. Cross-sectional. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) was used to predict five depression symptom phenotypes from the Hamilton and MADRS depression scales previously derived from factor analysis: (1) Anhedonia, (2) Suicidality, (3) Appetite, (4) Sleep Disturbance, and (5) Anxiety. Our deep learning model was deployed to predict each factor score via learning deep feature representations from 3D sMRI patches in 34 a <i>priori</i> regions-of-interests (ROIs). ROI-level prediction accuracy was used to identify the most discriminative brain regions associated with prediction of factor scores representing each of the five symptom phenotypes. Factor-level results found significant predictive models for Anxiety and Suicidality factors. ROI-level results suggest the most LLD-associated discriminative regions in predicting all five symptom factors were located in the anterior cingulate and orbital frontal cortex. We validated the effectiveness of using deep learning approaches on sMRI for predicting depression symptom phenotypes in LLD. We were able to identify deep embedded local morphological differences in symptom phenotypes in the brains of those with LLD, which is promising for symptom-targeted treatment of LLD. Future research with machine learning models integrating multimodal imaging and clinical data can provide additional discriminative information."
Neuroimaging-based classification of PTSD using data-driven computational approaches: A multisite big data study from the ENIGMA-PGC PTSD consortium.,37858907,Rajendra A Morey,Duke University,N/A,"Recent advances in data-driven computational approaches have been helpful in devising tools to objectively diagnose psychiatric disorders. However, current machine learning studies limited to small homogeneous samples, different methodologies, and different imaging collection protocols, limit the ability to directly compare and generalize their results. Here we aimed to classify individuals with PTSD versus controls and assess the generalizability using a large heterogeneous brain datasets from the ENIGMA-PGC PTSD Working group. We analyzed brain MRI data from 3,477 structural-MRI; 2,495 resting state-fMRI; and 1,952 diffusion-MRI. First, we identified the brain features that best distinguish individuals with PTSD from controls using traditional machine learning methods. Second, we assessed the utility of the denoising variational autoencoder (DVAE) and evaluated its classification performance. Third, we assessed the generalizability and reproducibility of both models using leave-one-site-out cross-validation procedure for each modality. We found lower performance in classifying PTSD vs. controls with data from over 20 sites (60 % test AUC for s-MRI, 59 % for rs-fMRI and 56 % for d-MRI), as compared to other studies run on single-site data. The performance increased when classifying PTSD from HC without trauma history in each modality (75 % AUC). The classification performance remained intact when applying the DVAE framework, which reduced the number of features. Finally, we found that the DVAE framework achieved better generalization to unseen datasets compared with the traditional machine learning frameworks, albeit performance was slightly above chance. These results have the potential to provide a baseline classification performance for PTSD when using large scale neuroimaging datasets. Our findings show that the control group used can heavily affect classification performance. The DVAE framework provided better generalizability for the multi-site data. This may be more significant in clinical practice since the neuroimaging-based diagnostic DVAE classification models are much less site-specific, rendering them more generalizable."
"Perspectives, experiences, and concerns with cyclical vomiting syndrome: Insights from online targeted-disease forums.",38191754,Brennan M R Spiegel,Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,Division of Health Services Research,"There is limited research examining the biopsychosocial impact of cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) on patients. This study aims to assess individuals' experiences, fears, and concerns associated with CVS and the impact of CVS on their daily lives. We employed social netnography to analyze publicly available posts related to CVS that were identified from six US online forums and Twitter. A randomly selected sub-cohort of posts per pre-defined criteria was first qualitatively analyzed using an inductive thematic approach. Then, machine learning topic modeling was applied to explore themes in an unsupervised manner for the entire corpus of posts. Afterward, findings from the qualitative and quantitative approaches were integrated to generate a thematic network. Based on the 39,179 collected posts, seven domain themes were identified. Overall, 41.4% of the posts were related to ""biopsychosocial burden"" of CVS, including physical impact, psychological impact, and social impact. In 22.3% of posts, individuals shared their experience of ""interactions with the healthcare system"", and 14.2% of posts were related to ""perceived CVS triggers."" Individuals also shared ""solutions to alleviate their symptoms"" and ""mental health needs"" in 10.2% and 8.8% of posts, respectively. Finally, 6.1% of the posts were about ""seeking/sharing support"" with others. This is the first social netnography study to describe the in-depth experiences of individuals living with CVS and the marked impact on their physical, mental, and social health. The study also highlights the unmet need for effective therapies, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, to alleviate the biopsychosocial impact of CVS."
Assessment of Neuroanatomical Endophenotypes of Autism Spectrum Disorder and Association With Characteristics of Individuals With Schizophrenia and the General Population.,37017948,Christos Davatzikos,University of Pennsylvania,AI 2 D Center for Data Science for Integrated Diagnostics,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with significant clinical, neuroanatomical, and genetic heterogeneity that limits precision diagnostics and treatment. To assess distinct neuroanatomical dimensions of ASD using novel semisupervised machine learning methods and to test whether the dimensions can serve as endophenotypes also in non-ASD populations. This cross-sectional study used imaging data from the publicly available Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) repositories as the discovery cohort. The ABIDE sample included individuals diagnosed with ASD aged between 16 and 64 years and age- and sex-match typically developing individuals. Validation cohorts included individuals with schizophrenia from the Psychosis Heterogeneity Evaluated via Dimensional Neuroimaging (PHENOM) consortium and individuals from the UK Biobank to represent the general population. The multisite discovery cohort included 16 internationally distributed imaging sites. Analyses were performed between March 2021 and March 2022. The trained semisupervised heterogeneity through discriminative analysis models were tested for reproducibility using extensive cross-validations. It was then applied to individuals from the PHENOM and the UK Biobank. It was hypothesized that neuroanatomical dimensions of ASD would display distinct clinical and genetic profiles and would be prominent also in non-ASD populations. Heterogeneity through discriminative analysis models trained on T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance images of 307 individuals with ASD (mean [SD] age, 25.4 [9.8] years; 273 [88.9%] male) and 362 typically developing control individuals (mean [SD] age, 25.8 [8.9] years; 309 [85.4%] male) revealed that a 3-dimensional scheme was optimal to capture the ASD neuroanatomy. The first dimension (A1: aginglike) was associated with smaller brain volume, lower cognitive function, and aging-related genetic variants (FOXO3; Z = 4.65; P = 1.62 × 10-6). The second dimension (A2: schizophrenialike) was characterized by enlarged subcortical volumes, antipsychotic medication use (Cohen d = 0.65; false discovery rate-adjusted P = .048), partially overlapping genetic, neuroanatomical characteristics to schizophrenia (n = 307), and significant genetic heritability estimates in the general population (n = 14 786; mean [SD] h2, 0.71 [0.04]; P < 1 × 10-4). The third dimension (A3: typical ASD) was distinguished by enlarged cortical volumes, high nonverbal cognitive performance, and biological pathways implicating brain development and abnormal apoptosis (mean [SD] β, 0.83 [0.02]; P = 4.22 × 10-6). This cross-sectional study discovered 3-dimensional endophenotypic representation that may elucidate the heterogeneous neurobiological underpinnings of ASD to support precision diagnostics. The significant correspondence between A2 and schizophrenia indicates a possibility of identifying common biological mechanisms across the 2 mental health diagnoses."
Decoding the role of transcriptomic clocks in the human prefrontal cortex.,37163025,Janitza L Montalvo-Ortiz,Yale University School of Medicine,Division of Human Genetics,"Aging is a complex process with interindividual variability, which can be measured by aging biological clocks. Aging clocks are machine-learning algorithms guided by biological information and associated with mortality risk and a wide range of health outcomes. One of these aging clocks are transcriptomic clocks, which uses gene expression data to predict biological age; however, their functional role is unknown. Here, we profiled two transcriptomic clocks (RNAAgeCalc and knowledge-based deep neural network clock) in a large dataset of human postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) samples. We identified that deep-learning transcriptomic clock outperforms RNAAgeCalc to predict transcriptomic age in the human PFC. We identified associations of transcriptomic clocks with psychiatric-related traits. Further, we applied system biology algorithms to identify common gene networks among both clocks and performed pathways enrichment analyses to assess its functionality and prioritize genes involved in the aging processes. Identified gene networks showed enrichment for diseases of signal transduction by growth factor receptors and second messenger pathways. We also observed enrichment of genome-wide signals of mental and physical health outcomes and identified genes previously associated with human brain aging. Our findings suggest a link between transcriptomic aging and health disorders, including psychiatric traits. Further, it reveals functional genes within the human PFC that may play an important role in aging and health risk."
Deploying a national clinical text processing infrastructure.,38146986,Suzanne R Tamang,Stanford University,Division of Immunology and Rheumatology,"Clinical text processing offers a promising avenue for improving multiple aspects of healthcare, though operational deployment remains a substantial challenge. This case report details the implementation of a national clinical text processing infrastructure within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Two foundational use cases, cancer case management and suicide and overdose prevention, illustrate how text processing can be practically implemented at scale for diverse clinical applications using shared services. Insights from these use cases underline both commonalities and differences, providing a replicable model for future text processing applications. This project enables more efficient initiation, testing, and future deployment of text processing models, streamlining the integration of these use cases into healthcare operations. This project implementation is in a large integrated health delivery system in the United States, but we expect the lessons learned to be relevant to any health system, including smaller local and regional health systems in the United States."
Assessing spontaneous sensory neuron activity using in vivo calcium imaging.,38112748,George L Goodwin,King's College London,N/A,"Heightened spontaneous activity in sensory neurons is often reported in individuals living with chronic pain. It is possible to study this activity in rodents using electrophysiology, but these experiments require great skill and can be prone to bias. Here, we have examined whether in vivo calcium imaging with GCaMP6s can be used as an alternative approach. We show that spontaneously active calcium transients can be visualised in the fourth lumbar dorsal root ganglion (L4 DRG) through in vivo imaging in a mouse model of inflammatory pain. Application of lidocaine to the nerve, between the inflamed site and the DRG, silenced spontaneous firing and revealed the true baseline level of calcium for spontaneously active neurons. We used these data to train a machine learning algorithm to predict when a neuron is spontaneously active. We show that our algorithm is accurate in 2 different models of pain: intraplantar complete Freund adjuvant and antigen-induced arthritis, with accuracies of 90.0% ±1.2 and 85.9% ±2.1, respectively, assessed against visual inspection by an experienced observer. The algorithm can also detect neuronal activity in imaging experiments generated in a different laboratory using a different microscope configuration (accuracy = 94.0% ±2.2). We conclude that in vivo calcium imaging can be used to assess spontaneous activity in sensory neurons and provide a Google Colaboratory Notebook to allow anyone easy access to our novel analysis tool, for the assessment of spontaneous neuronal activity in their own imaging setups."
Comparing machine learning algorithms for non-invasive detection and classification of failure in piezoresistive bone cement via electrical impedance tomography.,38100565,H Ghaednia,Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital,Department of Orthopaedic Surgery,"At an estimated cost of $8 billion annually in the United States, revision surgeries to total joint replacements represent a substantial financial burden to the health care system and a tremendous mental and physical burden on patients and their caretakers. Fixation failures, such as implant loosening, wear, and mechanical instability of the poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) cement, which bonds the implant to the bone, are the main causes of long-term implant failure. Early and accurate diagnosis of cement failure is critical for developing novel therapeutic strategies and reducing the high risk of a misjudged revision. Unfortunately, prevailing imaging modalities, notably plain radiographs, struggle to detect the precursors of implant failure and are often interpreted incorrectly. Our prior work has shown that the modification of PMMA bone cement with low concentrations of conductive fillers makes it piezoresistive and therefore self-sensing. When combined with a conductivity imaging modality such as electrical impedance tomography (EIT), it is possible to monitor load transfer across the PMMA using cost-effective, physiologically benign, non-contact, and real-time electrical measurements. Despite the ability of EIT for monitoring load transfer across self-sensing PMMA bone cement, it is unable to accurately characterize failure mechanisms. Overcoming this challenge is critical to the success of this technology in practice. Therefore, we herein expand upon our previous results by integrating machine learning techniques with EIT for cement condition characterization with the goal of establishing the feasibility of even off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms to address this important problem. We survey a wide variety of different machine learning algorithms for application to this problem, including neural networks on voltage readings of an EIT phantom for tracking the spatial position of a sample, specifying defect orientation within a sample, and classifying defect types, including cracks and delaminations. In addition, we explore the utilization of principal component analysis (PCA) for pre-treating impedance signals in each of these problems. Within the tested algorithms, our results show clear advantages of neural networks, support vector machines, and K-nearest neighbor algorithms for interpreting EIT signals. We also show that PCA is an effective addition to machine learning. These preliminary results demonstrate that the combination of smart materials, EIT, and machine learning may be a powerful instrumentation tool for diagnosing the origin and evolution of mechanical failure in joint replacements."
Natural language processing system for rapid detection and intervention of mental health crisis chat messages.,37990134,Matthew K Nock,Harvard University,Department of Psychology,"Patients experiencing mental health crises often seek help through messaging-based platforms, but may face long wait times due to limited message triage capacity. Here we build and deploy a machine-learning-enabled system to improve response times to crisis messages in a large, national telehealth provider network. We train a two-stage natural language processing (NLP) system with key word filtering followed by logistic regression on 721 electronic medical record chat messages, of which 32% are potential crises (suicidal/homicidal ideation, domestic violence, or non-suicidal self-injury). Model performance is evaluated on a retrospective test set (4/1/21-4/1/22, N = 481) and a prospective test set (10/1/22-10/31/22, N = 102,471). In the retrospective test set, the model has an AUC of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.78-0.86), sensitivity of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.96-1.00), and PPV of 0.35 (95% CI: 0.309-0.4). In the prospective test set, the model has an AUC of 0.98 (95% CI: 0.966-0.984), sensitivity of 0.98 (95% CI: 0.96-0.99), and PPV of 0.66 (95% CI: 0.626-0.692). The daily median time from message receipt to crisis specialist triage ranges from 8 to 13 min, compared to 9 h before the deployment of the system. We demonstrate that a NLP-based machine learning model can reliably identify potential crisis chat messages in a telehealth setting. Our system integrates into existing clinical workflows, suggesting that with appropriate training, humans can successfully leverage ML systems to facilitate triage of crisis messages."
Generalizability and Out-of-Sample Predictive Ability of Associations Between Neuromelanin-Sensitive Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Psychosis in Antipsychotic-Free Individuals.,37938847,Guillermo Horga,Columbia University,Department of Psychiatry,"The link between psychosis and dopaminergic dysfunction is established, but no generalizable biomarkers with clear potential for clinical adoption exist. To replicate previous findings relating neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI), a proxy measure of dopamine function, to psychosis severity in antipsychotic-free individuals in the psychosis spectrum and to evaluate the out-of-sample predictive ability of NM-MRI for psychosis severity. This cross-sectional study recruited participants from 2019 to 2023 in the New York City area (main samples) and Mexico City area (external validation sample). The main samples consisted of 42 antipsychotic-free patients with schizophrenia, 53 antipsychotic-free individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR), and 52 matched healthy controls. An external validation sample consisted of 16 antipsychotic-naive patients with schizophrenia. NM-MRI contrast within a subregion of the substantia nigra previously linked to psychosis severity (a priori psychosis region of interest [ROI]) and psychosis severity measured using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) in schizophrenia and the Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes (SIPS) in CHR. The cross-validated performance of linear support vector regression to predict psychosis severity across schizophrenia and CHR was assessed, and a final trained model was tested on the external validation sample. Of the 163 included participants, 76 (46.6%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 29.2 (10.4) years. In the schizophrenia sample, higher PANSS positive total scores correlated with higher mean NM-MRI contrast in the psychosis ROI (t37 = 2.24, P = .03; partial r = 0.35; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.55). In the CHR sample, no significant association was found between higher SIPS positive total score and NM-MRI contrast in the psychosis ROI (t48 = -0.55, P = .68; partial r = -0.08; 95% CI, -0.36 to 0.23). The 10-fold cross-validated prediction accuracy of psychosis severity was above chance in held-out test data (mean r = 0.305, P = .01; mean root-mean-square error [RMSE] = 1.001, P = .005). External validation prediction accuracy was also above chance (r = 0.422, P = .046; RMSE = 0.882, P = .047). This study provided a direct ROI-based replication of the in-sample association between NM-MRI contrast and psychosis severity in antipsychotic-free patients with schizophrenia. In turn, it failed to replicate such association in CHR individuals. Most critically, cross-validated machine-learning analyses provided a proof-of-concept demonstration that NM-MRI patterns can be used to predict psychosis severity in new data, suggesting potential for developing clinically useful tools."
Prediction of Early Antidepressant Efficacy in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder Based on Multidimensional Features of rs-fMRI and <i>P11</i> Gene DNA Methylation: Prédiction de l'efficacité précoce d'un antidépresseur chez des patients souffrant du trouble dépressif majeur d'après les caractéristiques multidimensionnelles de la méthylation de l'ADN du gène P11 et de la IRMf-rs.,37920958,Yonggui Yuan,Zhongda Hospital,Department of Psychosomatics and Psychiatry,"This study established a machine learning model based on the multidimensional data of resting-state functional activity of the brain and <i>P11</i> gene DNA methylation to predict the early efficacy of antidepressant treatment in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). A total of 98 Han Chinese MDD were analysed in this study. Patients were divided into 51 responders and 47 nonresponders according to whether the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 items (HAMD-17) reduction rate was ≥50% after 2 weeks of antidepressant treatment. At baseline, the Illumina HiSeq Platform was used to detect the methylation of 74 CpG sites of the <i>P11</i> gene in peripheral blood samples. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) scan detected the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and functional connectivity (FC) in 116 brain regions. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis method was used to perform feature reduction and feature selection. Four typical machine learning methods were used to establish support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), Naïve Bayes (NB), and logistic regression (LR) prediction models based on different combinations of functional activity of the brain, <i>P11</i> gene DNA methylation and clinical/demographic features after screening. The SVM model based on ALFF, ReHo, FC, <i>P11</i> methylation, and clinical/demographic features showed the best performance, with 95.92% predictive accuracy and 0.9967 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, which was better than RF, NB, and LR models. The multidimensional data features combining rs-fMRI, DNA methylation, and clinical/demographic features can predict the early antidepressant efficacy in MDD."
Biological age and brain age in midlife: relationship to multimorbidity and mental health.,37804610,Jiangtao Gou,Villanova University,Department of Mathematics and Statistics,"Biological age and brain age estimated using biological and neuroimaging measures have recently emerged as surrogate aging biomarkers shown to be predictive of diverse health outcomes. As aging underlies the development of many chronic conditions, surrogate aging biomarkers capture health at the whole person level, having the potential to improve our understanding of multimorbidity. Our study investigates whether elevated biological age and brain age are associated with an increased risk of multimorbidity using a large dataset from the Midlife in the United States Refresher study. Ensemble learning is utilized to combine multiple machine learning models to estimate biological age using a comprehensive set of biological markers. Brain age is obtained using Gaussian processes regression and neuroimaging data. Our study is the first to examine the relationship between accelerated brain age and multimorbidity. Furthermore, it is the first attempt to explore how biological age and brain age are related to multimorbidity in mental health. Our findings hold the potential to advance the understanding of disease accumulation and their relationship with aging."
Effects of MRI scanner manufacturers in classification tasks with deep learning models.,37798392,Yee-Hong Yang,University of Alberta,Department of Computing Science,"Deep learning has become a leading subset of machine learning and has been successfully employed in diverse areas, ranging from natural language processing to medical image analysis. In medical imaging, researchers have progressively turned towards multi-center neuroimaging studies to address complex questions in neuroscience, leveraging larger sample sizes and aiming to enhance the accuracy of deep learning models. However, variations in image pixel/voxel characteristics can arise between centers due to factors including differences in magnetic resonance imaging scanners. Such variations create challenges, particularly inconsistent performance in machine learning-based approaches, often referred to as domain shift, where the trained models fail to achieve satisfactory or improved results when confronted with dissimilar test data. This study analyzes the performance of multiple disease classification tasks using multi-center MRI data obtained from three widely used scanner manufacturers (GE, Philips, and Siemens) across several deep learning-based networks. Furthermore, we investigate the efficacy of mitigating scanner vendor effects using ComBat-based harmonization techniques when applied to multi-center datasets of 3D structural MR images. Our experimental results reveal a substantial decline in classification performance when models trained on one type of scanner manufacturer are tested with data from different manufacturers. Moreover, despite applying ComBat-based harmonization, the harmonized images do not demonstrate any noticeable performance enhancement for disease classification tasks."
Brain Functional Connectome Defines a Transdiagnostic Dimension Shared by Cognitive Function and Psychopathology in Preadolescents.,37769982,Yihong Yang,National Institute on Drug Abuse,N/A,"Cognitive function and general psychopathology are two important classes of human behavior dimensions that are individually related to mental disorders across diagnostic categories. However, whether these two transdiagnostic dimensions are linked to common or distinct brain networks that convey resilience or risk for the development of psychiatric disorders remains unclear. The current study is a longitudinal investigation with 11,875 youths from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study at ages 9 to 10 years at the onset of the study. A machine learning approach based on canonical correlation analysis was used to identify latent dimensional associations of the resting-state functional connectome with multidomain behavioral assessments including cognitive functions and psychopathological measures. For the latent resting-state functional connectivity factor showing a robust behavioral association, its ability to predict psychiatric disorders was assessed using 2-year follow-up data, and its genetic association was evaluated using twin data from the same cohort. A latent functional connectome pattern was identified that showed a strong and generalizable association with the multidomain behavioral assessments (5-fold cross-validation: ρ = 0.68-0.73 for the training set [n = 5096]; ρ = 0.56-0.58 for the test set [n = 1476]). This functional connectome pattern was highly heritable (h<sup>2</sup> = 74.42%, 95% CI: 56.76%-85.42%), exhibited a dose-response relationship with the cumulative number of psychiatric disorders assessed concurrently and at 2 years post-magnetic resonance imaging scan, and predicted the transition of diagnosis across disorders over the 2-year follow-up period. These findings provide preliminary evidence for a transdiagnostic connectome-based measure that underlies individual differences in the development of psychiatric disorders during early adolescence."
Strong Association of Depression and Anxiety With the Presence of Back Pain While Impact of Spinal Imaging Findings is Limited: Analysis of an MRI Cohort Study.,37742905,Sophia Stoecklein,University Hospital,Department of Radiology,"Development of back pain is multifactorial, and it is not well understood which factors are the main drivers of the disease. We therefore applied a machine-learning approach to an existing large cohort study data set and sought to identify and rank the most important contributors to the presence of back pain amongst the documented parameters of the cohort. Data from 399 participants in the KORA-MRI (Cooperative health research in the region Augsburg-magnetic resonance imaging) (Cooperative Health Research in the Region Augsburg) study was analyzed. The data set included MRI images of the whole body, including the spine, metabolic, sociodemographic, anthropometric, and cardiovascular data. The presence of back pain was one of the documented items in this data set. Applying a machine-learning approach to this preexisting data set, we sought to identify the variables that were most strongly associated with back pain. Mediation analysis was performed to evaluate the underlying mechanisms of the identified associations. We found that depression and anxiety were the 2 most selected predictors for back pain in our model. Additionally, body mass index, spinal canal width and disc generation, medium and heavy physical work as well as cardiovascular factors were among the top 10 most selected predictors. Using mediation analysis, we found that the effects of anxiety and depression on the presence of back pain were mainly direct effects that were not mediated by spinal imaging. In summary, we found that psychological factors were the most important predictors of back pain in our cohort. This supports the notion that back pain should be treated in a personalized multidimensional framework. PERSPECTIVE: This article presents a wholistic approach to the problem of back pain. We found that depression and anxiety were the top predictors of back pain in our cohort. This strengthens the case for a multidimensional treatment approach to back pain, possibly with a special emphasis on psychological factors."
Improving disease classification performance and explainability of deep learning models in radiology with heatmap generators.,37492678,Farzad Khalvati,The Hospital for Sick Children,Department of Diagnostic Imaging,"As deep learning is widely used in the radiology field, the explainability of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models is becoming increasingly essential to gain clinicians' trust when using the models for diagnosis. In this research, three experiment sets were conducted with a U-Net architecture to improve the disease classification performance while enhancing the heatmaps corresponding to the model's focus through incorporating heatmap generators during training. All experiments used the dataset that contained chest radiographs, associated labels from one of the three conditions [""normal"", ""congestive heart failure (CHF)"", and ""pneumonia""], and numerical information regarding a radiologist's eye-gaze coordinates on the images. The paper that introduced this dataset developed a U-Net model, which was treated as the baseline model for this research, to show how the eye-gaze data can be used in multi-modal training for explainability improvement and disease classification. To compare the classification performances among this research's three experiment sets and the baseline model, the 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were measured. The best method achieved an AUC of 0.913 with a 95% CI of [0.860, 0.966]. ""Pneumonia"" and ""CHF"" classes, which the baseline model struggled the most to classify, had the greatest improvements, resulting in AUCs of 0.859 with a 95% CI of [0.732, 0.957] and 0.962 with a 95% CI of [0.933, 0.989], respectively. The decoder of the U-Net for the best-performing proposed method generated heatmaps that highlight the determining image parts in model classifications. These predicted heatmaps, which can be used for the explainability of the model, also improved to align well with the radiologist's eye-gaze data. Hence, this work showed that incorporating heatmap generators and eye-gaze information into training can simultaneously improve disease classification and provide explainable visuals that align well with how the radiologist viewed the chest radiographs when making diagnosis."
"THINGS-data, a multimodal collection of large-scale datasets for investigating object representations in human brain and behavior.",36847339,Chris I Baker,National Institute of Mental Health,Laboratory of Brain and Cognition,"Understanding object representations requires a broad, comprehensive sampling of the objects in our visual world with dense measurements of brain activity and behavior. Here, we present THINGS-data, a multimodal collection of large-scale neuroimaging and behavioral datasets in humans, comprising densely sampled functional MRI and magnetoencephalographic recordings, as well as 4.70 million similarity judgments in response to thousands of photographic images for up to 1,854 object concepts. THINGS-data is unique in its breadth of richly annotated objects, allowing for testing countless hypotheses at scale while assessing the reproducibility of previous findings. Beyond the unique insights promised by each individual dataset, the multimodality of THINGS-data allows combining datasets for a much broader view into object processing than previously possible.

Using Social Media to Help Understand Patient-Reported Health Outcomes of Post-COVID-19 Condition: Natural Language Processing Approach.,37725432,Angela M Cheung,University of Toronto,Department of Medicine and Joint Department of Medical Imaging,"While scientific knowledge of post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) is growing, there remains significant uncertainty in the definition of the disease, its expected clinical course, and its impact on daily functioning. Social media platforms can generate valuable insights into patient-reported health outcomes as the content is produced at high resolution by patients and caregivers, representing experiences that may be unavailable to most clinicians. In this study, we aimed to determine the validity and effectiveness of advanced natural language processing approaches built to derive insight into PCC-related patient-reported health outcomes from social media platforms Twitter and Reddit. We extracted PCC-related terms, including symptoms and conditions, and measured their occurrence frequency. We compared the outputs with human annotations and clinical outcomes and tracked symptom and condition term occurrences over time and locations to explore the pipeline's potential as a surveillance tool. We used bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) models to extract and normalize PCC symptom and condition terms from English posts on Twitter and Reddit. We compared 2 named entity recognition models and implemented a 2-step normalization task to map extracted terms to unique concepts in standardized terminology. The normalization steps were done using a semantic search approach with BERT biencoders. We evaluated the effectiveness of BERT models in extracting the terms using a human-annotated corpus and a proximity-based score. We also compared the validity and reliability of the extracted and normalized terms to a web-based survey with more than 3000 participants from several countries. UmlsBERT-Clinical had the highest accuracy in predicting entities closest to those extracted by human annotators. Based on our findings, the top 3 most commonly occurring groups of PCC symptom and condition terms were systemic (such as fatigue), neuropsychiatric (such as anxiety and brain fog), and respiratory (such as shortness of breath). In addition, we also found novel symptom and condition terms that had not been categorized in previous studies, such as infection and pain. Regarding the co-occurring symptoms, the pair of fatigue and headaches was among the most co-occurring term pairs across both platforms. Based on the temporal analysis, the neuropsychiatric terms were the most prevalent, followed by the systemic category, on both social media platforms. Our spatial analysis concluded that 42% (10,938/26,247) of the analyzed terms included location information, with the majority coming from the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. The outcome of our social media-derived pipeline is comparable with the results of peer-reviewed articles relevant to PCC symptoms. Overall, this study provides unique insights into patient-reported health outcomes of PCC and valuable information about the patient's journey that can help health care providers anticipate future needs.

Machine Learning of Functional Connectivity to Biotype Alcohol and Nicotine Use Disorders.,37696489,Jinbo Bi,University of Connecticut,Department of Computer Science and Engineering,"Magnetic resonance imaging provides noninvasive tools to investigate alcohol use disorder (AUD) and nicotine use disorder (NUD) and neural phenotypes for genetic studies. A data-driven transdiagnostic approach could provide a new perspective on the neurobiology of AUD and NUD. Using samples of individuals with AUD (n = 140), individuals with NUD (n = 249), and healthy control participants (n = 461) from the UK Biobank, we integrated clinical, neuroimaging, and genetic markers to identify biotypes of AUD and NUD. We partitioned participants with AUD and NUD based on resting-state functional connectivity (FC) features associated with clinical metrics. A multitask artificial neural network was trained to evaluate the cluster-defined biotypes and jointly infer AUD and NUD diagnoses. Three biotypes-primary NUD, mixed NUD/AUD with depression and anxiety, and mixed AUD/NUD-were identified. Multitask classifiers incorporating biotype knowledge achieved higher area under the curve (AUD: 0.76, NUD: 0.74) than single-task classifiers without biotype differentiation (AUD: 0.61, NUD: 0.64). Cerebellar FC features were important in distinguishing the 3 biotypes. The biotype of mixed NUD/AUD with depression and anxiety demonstrated the largest number of FC features (n = 5), all related to the visual cortex, that significantly differed from healthy control participants and were validated in a replication sample (p < .05). A polymorphism in TNRC6A was associated with the mixed AUD/NUD biotype in both the discovery (p = 7.3 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) and replication (p = 4.2 × 10<sup>-2</sup>) sets. Biotyping and multitask learning using FC features can characterize the clinical and genetic profiles of AUD and NUD and help identify cerebellar and visual circuit markers to differentiate the AUD/NUD group from the healthy control group. These markers support a new growing body of literature."
Delayed and More Variable Unimanual and Bimanual Finger Tapping in Alzheimer's Disease: Associations with Biomarkers and Applications for Classification.,37694362,Kevin Duff,University of Utah,Department of Neurology,"Despite reports of gross motor problems in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), fine motor function has been relatively understudied. We examined if finger tapping is affected in AD, related to AD biomarkers, and able to classify MCI or AD. Forty-seven cognitively normal, 27 amnestic MCI, and 26 AD subjects completed unimanual and bimanual computerized tapping tests. We tested 1) group differences in tapping with permutation models; 2) associations between tapping and biomarkers (PET amyloid-β, hippocampal volume, and APOEɛ4 alleles) with linear regression; and 3) the predictive value of tapping for group classification using machine learning. AD subjects had slower reaction time and larger speed variability than controls during all tapping conditions, except for dual tapping. MCI subjects performed worse than controls on reaction time and speed variability for dual and non-dominant hand tapping. Tapping speed and variability were related to hippocampal volume, but not to amyloid-β deposition or APOEɛ4 alleles. Random forest classification (overall accuracy = 70%) discriminated control and AD subjects, but poorly discriminated MCI from controls or AD. MCI and AD are linked to more variable finger tapping with slower reaction time. Associations between finger tapping and hippocampal volume, but not amyloidosis, suggest that tapping deficits are related to neuropathology that presents later during the disease. Considering that tapping performance is able to differentiate between control and AD subjects, it can offer a cost-efficient tool for augmenting existing AD biomarkers."
A tale of two lexica: Investigating computational pressures on word representation with neural networks.,37051161,David W Gow,Massachusetts General Hospital,Department of Neurology,"The notion of a single localized store of word representations has become increasingly less plausible as evidence has accumulated for the widely distributed neural representation of wordform grounded in motor, perceptual, and conceptual processes. Here, we attempt to combine machine learning methods and neurobiological frameworks to propose a computational model of brain systems potentially responsible for wordform representation. We tested the hypothesis that the functional specialization of word representation in the brain is driven partly by computational optimization. This hypothesis directly addresses the unique problem of mapping sound and articulation vs. mapping sound and meaning. We found that artificial neural networks trained on the mapping between sound and articulation performed poorly in recognizing the mapping between sound and meaning and vice versa. Moreover, a network trained on both tasks simultaneously could not discover the features required for efficient mapping between sound and higher-level cognitive states compared to the other two models. Furthermore, these networks developed internal representations reflecting specialized task-optimized functions without explicit training. Together, these findings demonstrate that different task-directed representations lead to more focused responses and better performance of a machine or algorithm and, hypothetically, the brain. Thus, we imply that the functional specialization of word representation mirrors a computational optimization strategy given the nature of the tasks that the human brain faces."
Decoding the role of transcriptomic clocks in the human prefrontal cortex.,37163025,Janitza L Montalvo-Ortiz,Yale University School of Medicine,Division of Human Genetics,"Aging is a complex process with interindividual variability, which can be measured by aging biological clocks. Aging clocks are machine-learning algorithms guided by biological information and associated with mortality risk and a wide range of health outcomes. One of these aging clocks are transcriptomic clocks, which uses gene expression data to predict biological age; however, their functional role is unknown. Here, we profiled two transcriptomic clocks (RNAAgeCalc and knowledge-based deep neural network clock) in a large dataset of human postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) samples. We identified that deep-learning transcriptomic clock outperforms RNAAgeCalc to predict transcriptomic age in the human PFC. We identified associations of transcriptomic clocks with psychiatric-related traits. Further, we applied system biology algorithms to identify common gene networks among both clocks and performed pathways enrichment analyses to assess its functionality and prioritize genes involved in the aging processes. Identified gene networks showed enrichment for diseases of signal transduction by growth factor receptors and second messenger pathways. We also observed enrichment of genome-wide signals of mental and physical health outcomes and identified genes previously associated with human brain aging. Our findings suggest a link between transcriptomic aging and health disorders, including psychiatric traits. Further, it reveals functional genes within the human PFC that may play an important role in aging and health risk."
Measures of Connectivity and Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Volumes and Depressive Symptoms Following Treatment With Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors in Adolescents.,37540512,David A Brent,University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine,Department of Psychiatry,"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are considered a first-line pharmacological treatment for adolescent depression with moderate or higher levels of symptom severity. Thus, it is important to understand neurobiological changes related to SSRIs during the course of treatment for adolescents with depression. To examine neurobiological changes associated with SSRI treatment in adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) by measuring longitudinal changes in volume and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a core region of cognitive control. This cohort study was conducted with an open-label design. Adolescents with MDD and healthy controls were recruited at the Seoul National University Hospital (Seoul, South Korea). Adolescents with MDD were treated with escitalopram for 8 weeks. Data analysis was conducted between April 2021 and February 2022. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised. The outcome measure was defined as the change in Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised scores from week 0 (before treatment) to week 8 (after treatment) or upon termination. Participants completed structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) assessments before (week 0) and after (week 8) SSRI treatment. Repeated measures analysis of variance and liner mixed model analyses were used to examine the longitudinal associations of SSRI treatment with DLPFC volume and rsFC between responders who showed at least a 40% decrease in depressive symptoms and nonresponders who did not. Ninety-five adolescents with MDD and 57 healthy controls were initially recruited. The final analyses of volume included 36 responders (mean [SD] age, 15.0 [1.6] years; 25 girls [69.4%]) and 26 nonresponders (mean [SD] age, 15.3 [1.5] years; 19 girls [73.1%]). Analyses of rsFC included 33 responders (mean [SD] age, 15.2 [1.5] years; 21 girls [63.6%]) and 26 nonresponders (mean [SD] age, 15.3 [1.5] years; 19 girls [73.1%]). The longitudinal associations of SSRI treatment were more evident in responders than in nonresponders. Responders showed significantly increased right DLPFC volume, decreased bilateral DLPFC rsFC with the superior frontal gyri, and decreased left DLPFC rsFC with the ventromedial PFC after treatment compared with before treatment. Furthermore, increased right DLPFC volume was correlated with decreased rsFC between the right DLPFC and superior frontal gyri after SSRI treatment. The preliminary results of this cohort study suggest that the DLPFC volumetric and rsFC changes may serve as potential neurobiological treatment markers that are associated with symptom improvement in adolescents with MDD."
Brain morphometric features predict depression symptom phenotypes in late-life depression using a deep learning model.,37539384,Guy G Potter,Duke University Medical Center,Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences,"Our objective was to use deep learning models to identify underlying brain regions associated with depression symptom phenotypes in late-life depression (LLD). Diagnosed with LLD (<i>N</i> = 116) and enrolled in a prospective treatment study. Cross-sectional. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) was used to predict five depression symptom phenotypes from the Hamilton and MADRS depression scales previously derived from factor analysis: (1) Anhedonia, (2) Suicidality, (3) Appetite, (4) Sleep Disturbance, and (5) Anxiety. Our deep learning model was deployed to predict each factor score via learning deep feature representations from 3D sMRI patches in 34 a <i>priori</i> regions-of-interests (ROIs). ROI-level prediction accuracy was used to identify the most discriminative brain regions associated with prediction of factor scores representing each of the five symptom phenotypes. Factor-level results found significant predictive models for Anxiety and Suicidality factors. ROI-level results suggest the most LLD-associated discriminative regions in predicting all five symptom factors were located in the anterior cingulate and orbital frontal cortex. We validated the effectiveness of using deep learning approaches on sMRI for predicting depression symptom phenotypes in LLD. We were able to identify deep embedded local morphological differences in symptom phenotypes in the brains of those with LLD, which is promising for symptom-targeted treatment of LLD. Future research with machine learning models integrating multimodal imaging and clinical data can provide additional discriminative information."
Improving disease classification performance and explainability of deep learning models in radiology with heatmap generators.,37492678,Farzad Khalvati,The Hospital for Sick Children,Department of Diagnostic Imaging,"As deep learning is widely used in the radiology field, the explainability of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models is becoming increasingly essential to gain clinicians' trust when using the models for diagnosis. In this research, three experiment sets were conducted with a U-Net architecture to improve the disease classification performance while enhancing the heatmaps corresponding to the model's focus through incorporating heatmap generators during training. All experiments used the dataset that contained chest radiographs, associated labels from one of the three conditions [""normal"", ""congestive heart failure (CHF)"", and ""pneumonia""], and numerical information regarding a radiologist's eye-gaze coordinates on the images. The paper that introduced this dataset developed a U-Net model, which was treated as the baseline model for this research, to show how the eye-gaze data can be used in multi-modal training for explainability improvement and disease classification. To compare the classification performances among this research's three experiment sets and the baseline model, the 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were measured. The best method achieved an AUC of 0.913 with a 95% CI of [0.860, 0.966]. ""Pneumonia"" and ""CHF"" classes, which the baseline model struggled the most to classify, had the greatest improvements, resulting in AUCs of 0.859 with a 95% CI of [0.732, 0.957] and 0.962 with a 95% CI of [0.933, 0.989], respectively. The decoder of the U-Net for the best-performing proposed method generated heatmaps that highlight the determining image parts in model classifications. These predicted heatmaps, which can be used for the explainability of the model, also improved to align well with the radiologist's eye-gaze data. Hence, this work showed that incorporating heatmap generators and eye-gaze information into training can simultaneously improve disease classification and provide explainable visuals that align well with how the radiologist viewed the chest radiographs when making diagnosis."
Automated detection of cerebral microbleeds on MR images using knowledge distillation framework.,37492242,Mark Jenkinson,University of Oxford,Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences,"Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are associated with white matter damage, and various neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases. CMBs occur as small, circular hypointense lesions on T2*-weighted gradient recalled echo (GRE) and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) images, and hyperintense on quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) images due to their paramagnetic nature. Accurate automated detection of CMBs would help to determine quantitative imaging biomarkers (e.g., CMB count) on large datasets. In this work, we propose a fully automated, deep learning-based, 3-step algorithm, using structural and anatomical properties of CMBs from any single input image modality (e.g., GRE/SWI/QSM) for their accurate detections. In our method, the first step consists of an initial candidate detection step that detects CMBs with high sensitivity. In the second step, candidate discrimination step is performed using a knowledge distillation framework, with a multi-tasking teacher network that guides the student network to classify CMB and non-CMB instances in an offline manner. Finally, a morphological clean-up step further reduces false positives using anatomical constraints. We used four datasets consisting of different modalities specified above, acquired using various protocols and with a variety of pathological and demographic characteristics. On cross-validation within datasets, our method achieved a cluster-wise true positive rate (TPR) of over 90% with an average of <2 false positives per subject. The knowledge distillation framework improves the cluster-wise TPR of the student model by 15%. Our method is flexible in terms of the input modality and provides comparable cluster-wise TPR and better cluster-wise precision compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. When evaluating across different datasets, our method showed good generalizability with a cluster-wise TPR >80 % with different modalities. The python implementation of the proposed method is openly available."
Explainable classification of Parkinson's disease using deep learning trained on a large multi-center database of T1-weighted MRI datasets.,37079936,Nils D Forkert,University of Calgary,Department of Radiology,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a severe neurodegenerative disease that affects millions of people. Early diagnosis is important to facilitate prompt interventions to slow down disease progression. However, accurate PD diagnosis can be challenging, especially in the early disease stages. The aim of this work was to develop and evaluate a robust explainable deep learning model for PD classification trained from one of the largest collections of T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging datasets. A total of 2,041 T1-weighted MRI datasets from 13 different studies were collected, including 1,024 datasets from PD patients and 1,017 datasets from age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). The datasets were skull stripped, resampled to isotropic resolution, bias field corrected, and non-linearly registered to the MNI PD25 atlas. The Jacobian maps derived from the deformation fields together with basic clinical parameters were used to train a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify PD and HC subjects. Saliency maps were generated to display the brain regions contributing the most to the classification task as a means of explainable artificial intelligence. The CNN model was trained using an 85%/5%/10% train/validation/test split stratified by diagnosis, sex, and study. The model achieved an accuracy of 79.3%, precision of 80.2%, specificity of 81.3%, sensitivity of 77.7%, and AUC-ROC of 0.87 on the test set while performing similarly on an independent test set. Saliency maps computed for the test set data highlighted frontotemporal regions, the orbital-frontal cortex, and multiple deep gray matter structures as most important. The developed CNN model, trained on a large heterogenous database, was able to differentiate PD patients from HC subjects with high accuracy with clinically feasible classification explanations. Future research should aim to investigate the combination of multiple imaging modalities with deep learning and on validating these results in a prospective trial as a clinical decision support system."
Greater affective network maturity is associated with better clinical outcomes in women with early sexual trauma.,37403737,Mariann R Weierich,University of Nevada Reno,Department of Psychology,"Early-life adversity accelerates the maturation of affect-related circuitry, which might be a short-term adaptation with long-term tradeoffs. Sexual trauma is associated with a particularly strong impact on pubertal development and mental health outcomes. Our objective was to test the relations between trauma type, affective network maturity, and mental health outcomes in young women with trauma history. Trauma-exposed women aged 18-29 completed a clinical interview (<i>n</i> = 35) and an fMRI scan (<i>n</i> = 28). We used a public data set to train a machine learning algorithm to predict age from resting-state affective network connectivity and calculated network maturity as the difference between predicted and true age. We also performed principal component analysis on mental health outcomes and retained two components: clinical and state psychological outcomes. Compared to nonsexual trauma (<i>n</i> = 17), sexual trauma (<i>n</i> = 11) was associated with greater affective network maturity. In addition, for sexual trauma only, greater affective network maturity was associated with better clinical but not state psychological outcomes. These results suggest that sexual trauma during development might uniquely alter the maturational trajectory of affect-related circuitry, with distinct mental health consequences in emerging adulthood. Whereas delayed affective network maturation is associated with adverse clinical outcomes, accelerated affective network maturation might confer resilience in survivors."
The Brain Tumor Segmentation - Metastases (BraTS-METS) Challenge 2023: Brain Metastasis Segmentation on Pre-treatment MRI.,37396600,Mariam Aboian,Children's Hospital of Philadelphia,Department of Radiology,"The translation of AI-generated brain metastases (BM) segmentation into clinical practice relies heavily on diverse, high-quality annotated medical imaging datasets. The BraTS-METS 2023 challenge has gained momentum for testing and benchmarking algorithms using rigorously annotated internationally compiled real-world datasets. This study presents the results of the segmentation challenge and characterizes the challenging cases that impacted the performance of the winning algorithms. Untreated brain metastases on standard anatomic MRI sequences (T1, T2, FLAIR, T1PG) from eight contributed international datasets were annotated in stepwise method: published UNET algorithms, student, neuroradiologist, final approver neuroradiologist. Segmentations were ranked based on lesion-wise Dice and Hausdorff distance (HD95) scores. False positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) were rigorously penalized, receiving a score of 0 for Dice and a fixed penalty of 374 for HD95. The mean scores for the teams were calculated. Eight datasets comprising 1303 studies were annotated, with 402 studies (3076 lesions) released on Synapse as publicly available datasets to challenge competitors. Additionally, 31 studies (139 lesions) were held out for validation, and 59 studies (218 lesions) were used for testing. Segmentation accuracy was measured as rank across subjects, with the winning team achieving a LesionWise mean score of 7.9. The Dice score for the winning team was 0.65 ± 0.25. Common errors among the leading teams included false negatives for small lesions and misregistration of masks in space. The Dice scores and lesion detection rates of all algorithms diminished with decreasing tumor size, particularly for tumors smaller than 100 mm3. In conclusion, algorithms for BM segmentation require further refinement to balance high sensitivity in lesion detection with the minimization of false positives and negatives. The BraTS-METS 2023 challenge successfully curated well-annotated, diverse datasets and identified common errors, facilitating the translation of BM segmentation across varied clinical environments and providing personalized volumetric reports to patients undergoing BM treatment."
Diagnostic Classification of ASD Improves with Structural Connectivity of DTI and Logistic Regression.,37386959,Jac Fredo Agastinose Ronickom,Indian Institute of Technology (BHU),School of Bio-Medical Engineering,"In this study, we examined the structural connectivity (SC) of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typical development using the distance correlation and machine learning algorithm. We preprocessed diffusion tensor images using a standard pipeline and parcellated the brain into 48 regions using atlas. We derived diffusion measures in white matter tracts, such as fractional anisotropy, radial diffusivity, axial diffusivity, mean diffusivity, and mode of anisotropy. Additionally, SC is determined by the Euclidean distance between these features. The SC were ranked using XGBoost and significant features were fed as the input to the logistic regression classifier. We obtained an average 10-fold cross-validation classification accuracy of 81% for the top 20 features. The SC computed from the anterior limb of internal capsule L to superior corona radiata R regions significantly contributed to the classification models. Our study shows the potential utility of adopting SC changes as the biomarker for the diagnosis of ASD."
Assessment of Neuroanatomical Endophenotypes of Autism Spectrum Disorder and Association With Characteristics of Individuals With Schizophrenia and the General Population.,37017948,Christos Davatzikos,University of Pennsylvania,AI 2 D Center for Data Science for Integrated Diagnostics,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with significant clinical, neuroanatomical, and genetic heterogeneity that limits precision diagnostics and treatment. To assess distinct neuroanatomical dimensions of ASD using novel semisupervised machine learning methods and to test whether the dimensions can serve as endophenotypes also in non-ASD populations. This cross-sectional study used imaging data from the publicly available Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) repositories as the discovery cohort. The ABIDE sample included individuals diagnosed with ASD aged between 16 and 64 years and age- and sex-match typically developing individuals. Validation cohorts included individuals with schizophrenia from the Psychosis Heterogeneity Evaluated via Dimensional Neuroimaging (PHENOM) consortium and individuals from the UK Biobank to represent the general population. The multisite discovery cohort included 16 internationally distributed imaging sites. Analyses were performed between March 2021 and March 2022. The trained semisupervised heterogeneity through discriminative analysis models were tested for reproducibility using extensive cross-validations. It was then applied to individuals from the PHENOM and the UK Biobank. It was hypothesized that neuroanatomical dimensions of ASD would display distinct clinical and genetic profiles and would be prominent also in non-ASD populations. Heterogeneity through discriminative analysis models trained on T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance images of 307 individuals with ASD (mean [SD] age, 25.4 [9.8] years; 273 [88.9%] male) and 362 typically developing control individuals (mean [SD] age, 25.8 [8.9] years; 309 [85.4%] male) revealed that a 3-dimensional scheme was optimal to capture the ASD neuroanatomy. The first dimension (A1: aginglike) was associated with smaller brain volume, lower cognitive function, and aging-related genetic variants (FOXO3; Z = 4.65; P = 1.62 × 10-6). The second dimension (A2: schizophrenialike) was characterized by enlarged subcortical volumes, antipsychotic medication use (Cohen d = 0.65; false discovery rate-adjusted P = .048), partially overlapping genetic, neuroanatomical characteristics to schizophrenia (n = 307), and significant genetic heritability estimates in the general population (n = 14 786; mean [SD] h2, 0.71 [0.04]; P < 1 × 10-4). The third dimension (A3: typical ASD) was distinguished by enlarged cortical volumes, high nonverbal cognitive performance, and biological pathways implicating brain development and abnormal apoptosis (mean [SD] β, 0.83 [0.02]; P = 4.22 × 10-6). This cross-sectional study discovered 3-dimensional endophenotypic representation that may elucidate the heterogeneous neurobiological underpinnings of ASD to support precision diagnostics. The significant correspondence between A2 and schizophrenia indicates a possibility of identifying common biological mechanisms across the 2 mental health diagnoses."

Pancreatic Cystic Lesions: Next Generation of Radiologic Assessment.,37245934,Alec J Megibow,NYU Grossman School of Medicine,Department of Radiology,"Pancreatic cystic lesions are frequently identified on cross-sectional imaging. As many of these are presumed branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, these lesions generate much anxiety for the patients and clinicians, often necessitating long-term follow-up imaging and even unnecessary surgical resections. However, the incidence of pancreatic cancer is overall low for patients with incidental pancreatic cystic lesions. Radiomics and deep learning are advanced tools of imaging analysis that have attracted much attention in addressing this unmet need, however, current publications on this topic show limited success and large-scale research is needed."
Neuroimaging standards for research into small vessel disease-advances since 2013.,37236211,Joanna M Wardlaw,University of Edinburgh,N/A,"Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is common during ageing and can present as stroke, cognitive decline, neurobehavioural symptoms, or functional impairment. SVD frequently coexists with neurodegenerative disease, and can exacerbate cognitive and other symptoms and affect activities of daily living. Standards for Reporting Vascular Changes on Neuroimaging 1 (STRIVE-1) categorised and standardised the diverse features of SVD that are visible on structural MRI. Since then, new information on these established SVD markers and novel MRI sequences and imaging features have emerged. As the effect of combined SVD imaging features becomes clearer, a key role for quantitative imaging biomarkers to determine sub-visible tissue damage, subtle abnormalities visible at high-field strength MRI, and lesion-symptom patterns, is also apparent. Together with rapidly emerging machine learning methods, these metrics can more comprehensively capture the effect of SVD on the brain than the structural MRI features alone and serve as intermediary outcomes in clinical trials and future routine practice. Using a similar approach to that adopted in STRIVE-1, we updated the guidance on neuroimaging of vascular changes in studies of ageing and neurodegeneration to create STRIVE-2."
Addressing multi-site functional MRI heterogeneity through dual-expert collaborative learning for brain disease identification.,37227019,Mingxia Liu,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,Department of Radiology and BRIC,"Several studies employ multi-site rs-fMRI data for major depressive disorder (MDD) identification, with a specific site as the to-be-analyzed target domain and other site(s) as the source domain. But they usually suffer from significant inter-site heterogeneity caused by the use of different scanners and/or scanning protocols and fail to build generalizable models that can well adapt to multiple target domains. In this article, we propose a dual-expert fMRI harmonization (DFH) framework for automated MDD diagnosis. Our DFH is designed to simultaneously exploit data from a single labeled source domain/site and two unlabeled target domains for mitigating data distribution differences across domains. Specifically, the DFH consists of a domain-generic student model and two domain-specific teacher/expert models that are jointly trained to perform knowledge distillation through a deep collaborative learning module. A student model with strong generalizability is finally derived, which can be well adapted to unseen target domains and analysis of other brain diseases. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first attempts to investigate multi-target fMRI harmonization for MDD diagnosis. Comprehensive experiments on 836 subjects with rs-fMRI data from 3 different sites show the superiority of our method. The discriminative brain functional connectivities identified by our method could be regarded as potential biomarkers for fMRI-related MDD diagnosis."
Decoding the role of transcriptomic clocks in the human prefrontal cortex.,37163025,Janitza L Montalvo-Ortiz,Yale University School of Medicine,Division of Human Genetics,"Aging is a complex process with interindividual variability, which can be measured by aging biological clocks. Aging clocks are machine-learning algorithms guided by biological information and associated with mortality risk and a wide range of health outcomes. One of these aging clocks are transcriptomic clocks, which uses gene expression data to predict biological age; however, their functional role is unknown. Here, we profiled two transcriptomic clocks (RNAAgeCalc and knowledge-based deep neural network clock) in a large dataset of human postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) samples. We identified that deep-learning transcriptomic clock outperforms RNAAgeCalc to predict transcriptomic age in the human PFC. We identified associations of transcriptomic clocks with psychiatric-related traits. Further, we applied system biology algorithms to identify common gene networks among both clocks and performed pathways enrichment analyses to assess its functionality and prioritize genes involved in the aging processes. Identified gene networks showed enrichment for diseases of signal transduction by growth factor receptors and second messenger pathways. We also observed enrichment of genome-wide signals of mental and physical health outcomes and identified genes previously associated with human brain aging. Our findings suggest a link between transcriptomic aging and health disorders, including psychiatric traits. Further, it reveals functional genes within the human PFC that may play an important role in aging and health risk."
The effect of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) on whole-brain functional and effective connectivity.,37185950,Andreea O Diaconescu,Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH),N/A,"Psychedelics have emerged as promising candidate treatments for various psychiatric conditions, and given their clinical potential, there is a need to identify biomarkers that underlie their effects. Here, we investigate the neural mechanisms of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) using regression dynamic causal modelling (rDCM), a novel technique that assesses whole-brain effective connectivity (EC) during resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We modelled data from two randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over trials, in which 45 participants were administered 100 μg LSD and placebo in two resting-state fMRI sessions. We compared EC against whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) using classical statistics and machine learning methods. Multivariate analyses of EC parameters revealed predominantly stronger interregional connectivity and reduced self-inhibition under LSD compared to placebo, with the notable exception of weakened interregional connectivity and increased self-inhibition in occipital brain regions as well as subcortical regions. Together, these findings suggests that LSD perturbs the Excitation/Inhibition balance of the brain. Notably, whole-brain EC did not only provide additional mechanistic insight into the effects of LSD on the Excitation/Inhibition balance of the brain, but EC also correlated with global subjective effects of LSD and discriminated experimental conditions in a machine learning-based analysis with high accuracy (91.11%), highlighting the potential of using whole-brain EC to decode or predict subjective effects of LSD in the future."
"THINGS-data, a multimodal collection of large-scale datasets for investigating object representations in human brain and behavior.",36847339,Chris I Baker,National Institute of Mental Health,Laboratory of Brain and Cognition,"Understanding object representations requires a broad, comprehensive sampling of the objects in our visual world with dense measurements of brain activity and behavior. Here, we present THINGS-data, a multimodal collection of large-scale neuroimaging and behavioral datasets in humans, comprising densely sampled functional MRI and magnetoencephalographic recordings, as well as 4.70 million similarity judgments in response to thousands of photographic images for up to 1,854 object concepts. THINGS-data is unique in its breadth of richly annotated objects, allowing for testing countless hypotheses at scale while assessing the reproducibility of previous findings. Beyond the unique insights promised by each individual dataset, the multimodality of THINGS-data allows combining datasets for a much broader view into object processing than previously possible. Our analyses demonstrate the high quality of the datasets and provide five examples of hypothesis-driven and data-driven applications. THINGS-data constitutes the core public release of the THINGS initiative (https://things-initiative.org) for bridging the gap between disciplines and the advancement of cognitive neuroscience."

Quantitative and Qualitative Evaluation of Provider Use of a Novel Machine Learning Model for Favorable Outcome Prediction.,37128409,Batia Wiesenfeld,NYU Stern School of Business,NYU Stern School of Business,"Predictive models may be particularly beneficial to clinicians when they face uncertainty and seek to develop a mental model of disease progression, but we know little about the post-implementation effects of predictive models on clinicians' experience of their work. Combining survey and interview methods, we found that providers using a predictive algorithm reported being significantly less uncertain and better able to anticipate, plan and prepare for patient discharge than non-users. The tool helped hospitalists form and develop confidence in their mental models of a novel disease (Covid-19). Yet providers' attention to the predictive tool declined as their confidence in their own mental models grew. Predictive algorithms that not only offer data but also provide feedback on decisions, thus supporting providers' motivation for continuous learning, hold promise for more sustained provider attention and cognition augmentation."
Brain Connectivity Signature Extractions from TMS Invoked EEGs.,37112420,Fow-Sen Choa,University of Maryland Baltimore County,N/A,"(1) Background: The correlations between brain connectivity abnormality and psychiatric disorders have been continuously investigated and progressively recognized. Brain connectivity signatures are becoming exceedingly useful for identifying patients, monitoring mental health disorders, and treatment. By using electroencephalography (EEG)-based cortical source localization along with energy landscape analysis techniques, we can statistically analyze transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-invoked EEG signals, for obtaining connectivity among different brain regions at a high spatiotemporal resolution. (2) Methods: In this study, we analyze EEG-based source localized alpha wave activity in response to TMS administered to three locations, namely, the left motor cortex (49 subjects), left prefrontal cortex (27 subjects), and the posterior cerebellum, or vermis (27 subjects) by using energy landscape analysis techniques to uncover connectivity signatures. We then perform two sample <i>t</i>-tests and use the (5 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) Bonferroni corrected <i>p</i>-valued cases for reporting six reliably stable signatures. (3) Results: Vermis stimulation invoked the highest number of connectivity signatures and the left motor cortex stimulation invoked a sensorimotor network state. In total, six out of 29 reliable, stable connectivity signatures are found and discussed. (4) Conclusions: We extend previous findings to localized cortical connectivity signatures for medical applications that serve as a baseline for future dense electrode studies."
A tale of two lexica: Investigating computational pressures on word representation with neural networks.,37051161,David W Gow,Massachusetts General Hospital,Department of Neurology,"The notion of a single localized store of word representations has become increasingly less plausible as evidence has accumulated for the widely distributed neural representation of wordform grounded in motor, perceptual, and conceptual processes. Here, we attempt to combine machine learning methods and neurobiological frameworks to propose a computational model of brain systems potentially responsible for wordform representation. We tested the hypothesis that the functional specialization of word representation in the brain is driven partly by computational optimization. This hypothesis directly addresses the unique problem of mapping sound and articulation vs. mapping sound and meaning. We found that artificial neural networks trained on the mapping between sound and articulation performed poorly in recognizing the mapping between sound and meaning and vice versa. Moreover, a network trained on both tasks simultaneously could not discover the features required for efficient mapping between sound and higher-level cognitive states compared to the other two models. Furthermore, these networks developed internal representations reflecting specialized task-optimized functions without explicit training. Together, these findings demonstrate that different task-directed representations lead to more focused responses and better performance of a machine or algorithm and, hypothetically, the brain. Thus, we imply that the functional specialization of word representation mirrors a computational optimization strategy given the nature of the tasks that the human brain faces."
"The presence, nature and network characteristics of behavioural phenotypes in temporal lobe epilepsy.",37038499,Bruce P Hermann,University of Wisconsin-Madison,Department of Neurology,"The relationship between temporal lobe epilepsy and psychopathology has had a long and contentious history with diverse views regarding the presence, nature and severity of emotional-behavioural problems in this patient population. To address these controversies, we take a new person-centred approach through the application of unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify underlying latent groups or behavioural phenotypes. Addressed are the distinct psychopathological profiles, their linked frequency, patterns and severity and the disruptions in morphological and network properties that underlie the identified latent groups. A total of 114 patients and 83 controls from the Epilepsy Connectome Project were administered the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment inventory from which six Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-oriented scales were analysed by unsupervised machine learning analytics to identify latent patient groups. Identified clusters were contrasted to controls as well as to each other in order to characterize their association with sociodemographic, clinical epilepsy and morphological and functional imaging network features. The concurrent validity of the behavioural phenotypes was examined through other measures of behaviour and quality of life. Patients overall exhibited significantly higher (abnormal) scores compared with controls. However, cluster analysis identified three latent groups: (i) unaffected, with no scale elevations compared with controls (Cluster 1, 37%); (ii) mild symptomatology characterized by significant elevations across several Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-oriented scales compared with controls (Cluster 2, 42%); and (iii) severe symptomatology with significant elevations across all scales compared with controls and the other temporal lobe epilepsy behaviour phenotype groups (Cluster 3, 21%). Concurrent validity of the behavioural phenotype grouping was demonstrated through identical stepwise links to abnormalities on independent measures including the National Institutes of Health Toolbox Emotion Battery and quality of life metrics. There were significant associations between cluster membership and sociodemographic (handedness and education), cognition (processing speed), clinical epilepsy (presence and lifetime number of tonic-clonic seizures) and neuroimaging characteristics (cortical volume and thickness and global graph theory metrics of morphology and resting-state functional MRI). Increasingly dispersed volumetric abnormalities and widespread disruptions in underlying network properties were associated with the most abnormal behavioural phenotype. Psychopathology in these patients is characterized by a series of discrete latent groups that harbour accompanying sociodemographic, clinical and neuroimaging correlates. The underlying neurobiological patterns suggest that the degree of psychopathology is linked to increasingly dispersed abnormal brain networks. Similar to cognition, machine learning approaches support a novel developing taxonomy of the comorbidities of epilepsy."
Assessment of Neuroanatomical Endophenotypes of Autism Spectrum Disorder and Association With Characteristics of Individuals With Schizophrenia and the General Population.,37017948,Christos Davatzikos,University of Pennsylvania,AI 2 D Center for Data Science for Integrated Diagnostics,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with significant clinical, neuroanatomical, and genetic heterogeneity that limits precision diagnostics and treatment. To assess distinct neuroanatomical dimensions of ASD using novel semisupervised machine learning methods and to test whether the dimensions can serve as endophenotypes also in non-ASD populations. This cross-sectional study used imaging data from the publicly available Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) repositories as the discovery cohort. The ABIDE sample included individuals diagnosed with ASD aged between 16 and 64 years and age- and sex-match typically developing individuals. Validation cohorts included individuals with schizophrenia from the Psychosis Heterogeneity Evaluated via Dimensional Neuroimaging (PHENOM) consortium and individuals from the UK Biobank to represent the general population. The multisite discovery cohort included 16 internationally distributed imaging sites. Analyses were performed between March 2021 and March 2022. The trained semisupervised heterogeneity through discriminative analysis models were tested for reproducibility using extensive cross-validations. It was then applied to individuals from the PHENOM and the UK Biobank. It was hypothesized that neuroanatomical dimensions of ASD would display distinct clinical and genetic profiles and would be prominent also in non-ASD populations. Heterogeneity through discriminative analysis models trained on T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance images of 307 individuals with ASD (mean [SD] age, 25.4 [9.8] years; 273 [88.9%] male) and 362 typically developing control individuals (mean [SD] age, 25.8 [8.9] years; 309 [85.4%] male) revealed that a 3-dimensional scheme was optimal to capture the ASD neuroanatomy. The first dimension (A1: aginglike) was associated with smaller brain volume, lower cognitive function, and aging-related genetic variants (FOXO3; Z = 4.65; P = 1.62 × 10-6). The second dimension (A2: schizophrenialike) was characterized by enlarged subcortical volumes, antipsychotic medication use (Cohen d = 0.65; false discovery rate-adjusted P = .048), partially overlapping genetic, neuroanatomical characteristics to schizophrenia (n = 307), and significant genetic heritability estimates in the general population (n = 14 786; mean [SD] h2, 0.71 [0.04]; P < 1 × 10-4). The third dimension (A3: typical ASD) was distinguished by enlarged cortical volumes, high nonverbal cognitive performance, and biological pathways implicating brain development and abnormal apoptosis (mean [SD] β, 0.83 [0.02]; P = 4.22 × 10-6). This cross-sectional study discovered 3-dimensional endophenotypic representation that may elucidate the heterogeneous neurobiological underpinnings of ASD to support precision diagnostics. The significant correspondence between A2 and schizophrenia indicates a possibility of identifying common biological mechanisms across the 2 mental health diagnoses."
Deep Learning-Based Feature Extraction with MRI Data in Neuroimaging Genetics for Alzheimer's Disease.,36980898,Wei Pan,University of Minnesota,Division of Biostatistics,"The prognosis and treatment of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been among the most important and challenging problems over the last few decades. To better understand the mechanism of AD, it is of great interest to identify genetic variants associated with brain atrophy. Commonly, in these analyses, neuroimaging features are extracted based on one of many possible brain atlases with FreeSurf and other popular software; this, however, may cause the loss of important information due to our incomplete knowledge about brain function embedded in these suboptimal atlases. To address the issue, we propose convolutional neural network (CNN) models applied to three-dimensional MRI data for the whole brain or multiple, divided brain regions to perform completely data-driven and automatic feature extraction. These image-derived features are then used as endophenotypes in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to identify associated genetic variants. When we applied this method to ADNI data, we identified several associated SNPs that have been previously shown to be related to several neurodegenerative/mental disorders, such as AD, depression, and schizophrenia."
Population modeling with machine learning can enhance measures of mental health - Open-data replication.,40568461,Janine Bijsterbosch,Washington University School of Medicine,Department of Radiology,"Efforts to predict trait phenotypes based on functional MRI data from large cohorts have been hampered by low prediction accuracy and/or small effect sizes. Although these findings are highly replicable, the small effect sizes are somewhat surprising given the presumed brain basis of phenotypic traits such as neuroticism and fluid intelligence. We aim to replicate previous work and additionally test multiple data manipulations that may improve prediction accuracy by addressing data pollution challenges. Specifically, we added additional fMRI features, averaged the target phenotype across multiple measurements to obtain more accurate estimates of the underlying trait, balanced the target phenotype's distribution through undersampling of majority scores, and identified data-driven subtypes to investigate the impact of between-participant heterogeneity. Our results replicated prior results from Dadi et al. (2021) in a larger sample. Each data manipulation further led to small but consistent improvements in prediction accuracy, which were largely additive when combining multiple data manipulations. Combining data manipulations (i.e., extended fMRI features, averaged target phenotype, balanced target phenotype distribution) led to a three-fold increase in prediction accuracy for fluid intelligence compared to prior work. These findings highlight the benefit of several relatively easy and low-cost data manipulations, which may positively impact future work."

Effects of Antidepressants on COVID-19 Outcomes: Retrospective Study on Large-Scale Electronic Health Record Data.,36881541,Mohammad Arif Ul Alam,University of Massachusetts,The Richard A Miner School of Computer & Information Sciences,"Antidepressants exert an anticholinergic effect in varying degrees, and various classes of antidepressants can produce a different effect on immune function. While the early use of antidepressants has a notional effect on COVID-19 outcomes, the relationship between the risk of COVID-19 severity and the use of antidepressants has not been properly investigated previously owing to the high costs involved with clinical trials. Large-scale observational data and recent advancements in statistical analysis provide ample opportunity to virtualize a clinical trial to discover the detrimental effects of the early use of antidepressants. We primarily aimed to investigate electronic health records for causal effect estimation and use the data for discovering the causal effects of early antidepressant use on COVID-19 outcomes. As a secondary aim, we developed methods for validating our causal effect estimation pipeline. We used the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a database aggregating health history for over 12 million people in the United States, including over 5 million with a positive COVID-19 test. We selected 241,952 COVID-19-positive patients (age >13 years) with at least 1 year of medical history. The study included a 18,584-dimensional covariate vector for each person and 16 different antidepressants. We used propensity score weighting based on the logistic regression method to estimate causal effects on the entire data. Then, we used the Node2Vec embedding method to encode SNOMED-CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms) medical codes and applied random forest regression to estimate causal effects. We used both methods to estimate causal effects of antidepressants on COVID-19 outcomes. We also selected few negatively effective conditions for COVID-19 outcomes and estimated their effects using our proposed methods to validate their efficacy. The average treatment effect (ATE) of using any one of the antidepressants was -0.076 (95% CI -0.082 to -0.069; P<.001) with the propensity score weighting method. For the method using SNOMED-CT medical embedding, the ATE of using any one of the antidepressants was -0.423 (95% CI -0.382 to -0.463; P<.001). We applied multiple causal inference methods with novel application of health embeddings to investigate the effects of antidepressants on COVID-19 outcomes. Additionally, we proposed a novel drug effect analysis-based evaluation technique to justify the efficacy of the proposed method. This study offers causal inference methods on large-scale electronic health record data to discover the effects of common antidepressants on COVID-19 hospitalization or a worse outcome. We found that common antidepressants may increase the risk of COVID-19 complications and uncovered a pattern where certain antidepressants were associated with a lower risk of hospitalization. While discovering the detrimental effects of these drugs on outcomes could guide preventive care, identification of beneficial effects would allow us to propose drug repurposing for COVID-19 treatment."
Endometriosis leads to central nervous system-wide glial activation in a mouse model of endometriosis.,36879305,Romana A Nowak,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Department of Animal Sciences,"Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a common symptom of endometriosis. Women with endometriosis are also at a high risk of suffering from anxiety, depression, and other psychological disorders. Recent studies indicate that endometriosis can affect the central nervous system (CNS). Changes in the functional activity of neurons, functional magnetic resonance imaging signals, and gene expression have been reported in the brains of rat and mouse models of endometriosis. The majority of the studies thus far have focused on neuronal changes, whereas changes in the glial cells in different brain regions have not been studied. Endometriosis was induced in female mice (45-day-old; n = 6-11/timepoint) by syngeneic transfer of donor uterine tissue into the peritoneal cavity of recipient animals. Brains, spines, and endometriotic lesions were collected for analysis at 4, 8, 16, and 32 days post-induction. Sham surgery mice were used as controls (n = 6/timepoint). The pain was assessed using behavioral tests. Using immunohistochemistry for microglia marker ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1 (IBA1) and machine learning ""Weka trainable segmentation"" plugin in Fiji, we evaluated the morphological changes in microglia in different brain regions. Changes in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) for astrocytes, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin-6 (IL6) were also evaluated. We observed an increase in microglial soma size in the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and hypothalamus of mice with endometriosis compared to sham controls on days 8, 16, and 32. The percentage of IBA1 and GFAP-positive area was increased in the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and hypothalamus in mice with endometriosis compared to sham controls on day 16. The number of microglia and astrocytes did not differ between endometriosis and sham control groups. We observed increased TNF and IL6 expression when expression levels from all brain regions were combined. Mice with endometriosis displayed reduced burrowing behavior and hyperalgesia in the abdomen and hind-paw. We believe this is the first report of central nervous system-wide glial activation in a mouse model of endometriosis. These results have significant implications for understanding chronic pain associated with endometriosis and other issues such as anxiety and depression in women with endometriosis."
Mechanisms underlying capsulotomy for refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder: neural correlates of negative affect processing overlap with deep brain stimulation targets.,36878966,Valerie Voon,University of Cambridge,Department of Psychiatry,"Ablative procedures such as anterior capsulotomy are potentially effective in refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Converging evidence suggests the ventral internal capsule white matter tracts traversing the rostral cingulate and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and thalamus is the optimal target for clinical efficacy across multiple deep brain stimulation targets for OCD. Here we ask which prefrontal regions and underlying cognitive processes might be implicated in the effects of capsulotomy by using both task fMRI and neuropsychological tests assessing OCD-relevant cognitive mechanisms known to map across prefrontal regions connected to the tracts targeted in capsulotomy. We tested OCD patients at least 6 months post-capsulotomy (n = 27), OCD controls (n = 33) and healthy controls (n = 34). We used a modified aversive monetary incentive delay paradigm with negative imagery and a within session extinction trial. Post-capsulotomy OCD subjects showed improved OCD symptoms, disability and quality of life with no differences in mood or anxiety or cognitive task performance on executive, inhibition, memory and learning tasks. Task fMRI revealed post-capsulotomy decreases in the nucleus accumbens during negative anticipation, and in the left rostral cingulate and left inferior frontal cortex during negative feedback. Post-capsulotomy patients showed attenuated accumbens-rostral cingulate functional connectivity. Rostral cingulate activity mediated capsulotomy improvement on obsessions. These regions overlap with optimal white matter tracts observed across multiple stimulation targets for OCD and might provide insights into further optimizing neuromodulation approaches. Our findings also suggest that aversive processing theoretical mechanisms may link ablative, stimulation and psychological interventions."
Prospective predictors of electronic nicotine delivery system initiation in tobacco naive young adults: A machine learning approach.,36865398,Mark D Litt,University of Connecticut Health Center,Division of Behavioral Sciences and Community Health,"The use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) is increasing among young adults. However, there are few studies regarding predictors of ENDS initiation in tobacco-naive young adults. Identifying the risk and protective factors of ENDS initiation that are specific to tobacco-naive young adults will enable the creation of targeted policies and prevention programs. This study used machine learning (ML) to create predictive models, identify risk and protective factors for ENDS initiation for tobacco-naive young adults, and the relationship between these predictors and the prediction of ENDS initiation. We used nationally representative data of tobacco-naive young adults in the U.S drawn from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) longitudinal cohort survey. Respondents were young adults (18-24 years) who had never used any tobacco products in Wave 4 and who completed Waves 4 and 5 interviews. ML techniques were used to create models and determine predictors at 1-year follow-up from Wave 4 data. Among the 2,746 tobacco-naive young adults at baseline, 309 initiated ENDS use at 1-year follow-up. The top five prospective predictors of ENDS initiation were susceptibility to ENDS, increased days of physical exercise specifically designed to strengthen muscles, frequency of social media use, marijuana use and susceptibility to cigarettes. This study identified previously unreported and emerging predictors of ENDS initiation that warrant further investigation and provided comprehensive information on the predictors of ENDS initiation. Furthermore, this study showed that ML is a promising technique that can aid ENDS monitoring and prevention programs."
